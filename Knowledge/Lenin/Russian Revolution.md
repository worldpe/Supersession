Russia did terrible in the Russo Japanese war of 1905, the economy was bad and there was a peaceful protest to give more workers rights that was put down violently 
This caused revolts to occur in response and workers councils formed spontaneously 
They emerged first as strike committees during the mass strike 
They were able to gain reforms themselves 
Leon Trotsky led the St Petersburg Soviet 
After this was repressed the Tsar did reforms, but then went back on them after 2 years, so people saw revolution as the only way to change 
1914 Russia enters WW1, they do badly yet again, and they had conscripted tons of peasants, soldiers saw themselves more as peasants in uniform and even formed their own soviets, this essentially is what births the red army 
The soviets consolidated power, and had various different parties. The Bolshevik party is the one that gained the most power due to it's consistent positions and opposition to making concessions to the tsar, which were not necessary. The Bolsheviks during the Russian revolution consolidate power, first by taking over the soviets. They also led the October Revolution and seized the winter palace, giving ah huge boost to their image. 
They consolidated control of the soviets by taking power in major urban ones, then downgraded the local and smaller ones into regional soviets with little power, merely executing the will of larger ones 
They additionally used the civil war as a prelude to purge all rival parties, created a one party state ideology 
Once they had total control of the soviets, the next step was to have the soviet elect the people in the Central Executive Committees and were the entire government to simplify it more every soviet was consolidated into a supreme soviet, which had no power
To consolidate further than this even, they banned party factionalism as a temporary measure during wartime, that was extended forever and is what Stalin used to consolidate power, he gained influence from a bureaucratic position gradually by controlling who could join the party and advance, making everyone loyal to him over time until this became an official role
