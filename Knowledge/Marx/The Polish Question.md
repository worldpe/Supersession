## The real nature of the Frankfurt Assembly.
The Assembly treats a revolutionary question as a juridical–parliamentary problem, and this alone already guarantees failure.
	Parliament substitutes speech for power, it debates as if recognition and sympathy could substitute for material force and political action.
	The Assembly understands politics as opinion-making rather than class struggle.
	It behaves as if history advances by correct arguments, not by collisions of social forces
The Assembly is structurally incapable of revolutionary action. 
	It has has no army, controls no executive power, and depends on existing states (Prussia, Austria) for enforcement..
	Before any argument is made, the setting already dooms the discussion.
	**A body that lacks power can only produce moral postures, not political results.**
Poland reveals the Assembly’s real constituency.
	Poland’s independence would weaken Russia, destabilize Austria and Prussia, and encourage revolutionary movements across Eastern Europe.
	The genuinely pro-Polish position would threaten the material interests of the German bourgeoisie.
	The Assembly’s hesitation is not intellectual confusion, it is class interest expressing itself through parliamentary form.
## The Assembly treats a revolutionary conflict as a question of opinion rather than of power..
**The Legal-Historical Arguments:** These argue over treaties, historical borders, dynastic rights,and constitutional legality.
	Legal arguments presuppose the legitimacy of the very order that destroyed Poland in the first place.
	You cannot appeal to law against a reality created by violence, conquest, and class domination.
	This reduces a revolutionary question to archival scholarship.
**The Realist Arguments against Poland:** Poland is impractical, it threatens European stability, and endangers German interests.
	This realism is simply the realism of bourgeois fear.
	It accepts the existing balance of power as natural and treats revolution as disorder.
	In reality, stability here means the stability of landlordism, absolutism, and bourgeois compromise.
**The German national interest arguments:** German unification must come first, Poland is a distraction.
	This argument reveals the Assembly’s class nature most clearly.
	German unity is conceived without revolutionary rupture, meaning it must be compatible with Prussian and Austrian dominance.
	Poland is sacrificed because supporting it would require breaking with these powers.
No argument can succeed because the Assembly refuses to acknowledge class struggle.
	It refuses to act outside legality, and it refuses to confront existing states materially.
	Even correct arguments become false in this context, because they are spoken by an institution that cannot act on them.
The Frankfurt Assembly is incapable of resolving revolutionary questions at all.
	Parliamentarism’s limit: it can debate consequences, but cannot initiate transformation.
	**Revolutionary change cannot be delegated to representative bodies that stand above and outside mass struggle.**
## Theory of institutional impotence under conditions of systemic conflict
Revolutionary problems are problems of power, not persuasion.
	They concern the destruction or reconfiguration of material relations enforced by state violence.
	Treating them as questions of legality, morality, or opinion misrecognizes their nature.
Representative parliamentary bodies embedded in the existing state cannot resolve revolutionary questions.
	They lack independent coercive capacity.
	They depend on the very powers whose overthrow or weakening would be required.
	As a result, debate substitutes for action.
Class interest expresses itself through procedural neutrality.
	The refusal to take sides or to act decisively appears as prudence, legality, or realism.
	In reality, it is the defense of existing property relations and geopolitical stability.
Failure is not accidental but structural.
	Even correct positions become inert when voiced by institutions incapable of acting on them.
	Parliamentarism can ratify outcomes after power has shifted, but it cannot produce the shift itself.
The modern analogue to the Frankfurt Assembly is deliberative institutions that lack sovereign power while claiming moral authority.
	Structural conflicts are reframed as technical, legal, or ethical questions.
	Inaction presented as responsibility.
