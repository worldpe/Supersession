#Philosophy/Marx [[Marx]]
The family, gender relations, and the state are not natural or eternal institutions but historically produced forms arising from changes in production, surplus, and property. Wwomen’s oppression originates in the rise of private property and inheritance, the state emerges as a coercive instrument to manage irreconcilable class antagonisms, and legal equality and monogamous marriage mask material domination. This is the historical materialist foundation for understanding gender, sexuality, and the state. Genuine human and sexual emancipation is impossible without the abolition of private property and class society itself.

Social reproduction (family, sexuality, gender) is part of the material base, not merely 'superstructure'.
	The family is not natural, but historically produced.
	The modern nuclear, monogamous, patriarchal family is not timeless, it is a historical form, tied to specific relations of production.
Patriarchy did not develop because men consciously plotted women's oppression. Family forms change because economic reproduction changes.
	changes in food production, tools, surplus, and property reorganized kinship systems, reorganized descent and inheritance, and reorganized sexual regulation.
Early human societies were communal, egalitarian, and stateless. Women held real social power under matrilineal systems. These societies were not utopias, but appropriate to low productivity.
	Equality without abundance is fragile, development creates contradiction.
Once societies can produce more than immediate subsistence, store wealth, or accumulate resources, then inequality becomes possible. Inheritance becomes central and social power detaches from kin reciprocity.
	Surplus creates property, class, patriarchy, and the state.
The overthrow of mother-right was the world-historic defeat of the female sex. Women’s oppression is not biological, it arises from private property, patrilineal inheritance, and women's exclusion from social production.
	Monogamy emerges from men's need to guarantee heirs, control of women's sexuality, and for the transmission of property.
	Gender oppression is historically specific and inseparable from class society.
The state does not arise from social contract, it does not express universal reason, and it does not reconcile society.
	The state arises when class antagonisms outgrow kinship regulation, private property requires protection, and coercion must become permanent.
The state is a public power standing above society, increasingly alienated from it.
	This applies equally to slave states, feudal monarchies, and bourgeois republics.
	Democracy only disguises this fact.
Consent under inequality is not freedom, equality before the law coexists with domination in reality.
	Formal freedom conceals coercion.
monogamy is structurally hypocritical, it enforces sexual discipline on women, while institutionalizing male freedom.
	Adultery and prostitution are not deviations, but functional complements of patriarchal monogamy.
Capitalism undermines patriarchy even as it reproduces it. Capitalism intensifies exploitation, commodities sexuality, and reproduces inequality, but also destroys patriarchal household production, draws women into wage labor, and weakens inheritance-based control.
	The proletarian family already partially escapes patriarchal monogamy not because capitalism is good but because property relations differ.
	This opens the historical possibility of gender equality.
Women's emancipation requires socialized production. The abolition of private property, socialization of domestic labor, and women's full participation in social production is needed to change the production relations, and thus the social relations.
	This is political economy applied to gender, not identity politics.
