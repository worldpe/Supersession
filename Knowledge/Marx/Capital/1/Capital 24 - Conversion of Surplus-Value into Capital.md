## 1. Capitalist Production on a Progressively Increasing Scale. The Inversion Which Converts the Property Laws of Commodity Production into Laws of Capitalist Appropriation
We go from (1) surplus-value coming from capital, to (2) capital coming from surplus-value. This shift explains how capitalism grows, and how the laws of commodity exchange become inverted into laws of capitalist domination.
- - -
**Accumulation:** using surplus-value as capital. Surplus-value is generated each production cycle. When the capitalist reinvests this surplus-value, it becomes new capital. This process expands capital beyond its initial size.
Surplus-value appears in the surplus product, before the capitalist can accumulate, the physical surplus must exist. Capital cannot grow unless surplus labour has produced additional means of production and means of subsistence. Accumulation is not just a monetary trick, it requires real surplus goods created by workers. Accumulation is possible only because the surplus product already contains the material elements of new capital.
Accumulation requires additional labour-power: If production expands, capital needs new workers. The working class reproduces itself and grows Capital simply absorbs the new labour-power each generation produces. Additional workers can be hired at the standard wage, and in that way the working class creates each year the capital that will exploit it the next year. "Creating capital out of capital".
The origin of the new capital is unpaid labour:
	The original £10,000 might be defended as coming from the capitalist’s own labour.
	But the additional £2,000 (and the £400 after that) unquestionably come from unpaid labour of workers.
	Thus the more capital a capitalist has, the more he can accumulate; accumulation is powered by past exploitation.
Each exchange remains fair from the standpoint of commodity laws. No individual transaction violates the laws of commodity exchange: (1) The worker sells labour-power at its value, (2) The capitalist pays its value, (3) The worker gets wages equivalent to his labour-power, (4) The capitalist receives the product that labour-power creates. In each isolated sale, equivalent is exchanged for equivalent; This is why political economists claim capitalism is fair.
But accumulation causes the laws of exchange to invert their meaning, although the exchange appears fair, it leads to a contradictory result: (1) Capital exchanged for labour-power is not the capitalist’s own product, (2) Capital is the product of the unpaid labour of workers, (3) Workers must buy back their own product with additional labour, (4) The worker produces both the capital that hires him and the surplus that enriches the capitalist. Thus the 'rights of property' derived from commodity exchange ultimately is the right of capital to appropriate unpaid labour, and the inability of workers to appropriate their own product. What looks like equality is actually domination.
This dialectical inversion is accomplished by simple reproduction. Even without accumulation, over multiple cycles: (1) All original capital disappears as a meaningful quantity, (2) All capital becomes accumulated surplus-value, (3) All capitalist property becomes past unpaid labour. The property system changes its character through its own operation, even when nothing unjust happens in any single exchange.
Accumulation intensifies the inversion, under expanded reproduction: (1) The capitalist consumes only part of surplus-value, (2) The rest becomes new capital, (3), This new capital exploits new labor, (4) Surplus-value grows exponentially, (5) The capitalist becomes owner only of surplus-value (past unpaid labour). Economists define capital correctly as "Accumulated wealth employed to produce surplus-value"; Capital is previously stolen labour used to exploit new labour.
Every step is legal and based on 'voluntary exchange', yet the result is a complete transformation of the property system: Producers become propertyless, owners become monopolists of the means of production, capital grows into a power dominating labour, and exchange becomes a mask hiding exploitation. The very "laws of commodity exchange" produce their opposite when generalized under capitalism.
## 2. The Political Economists Erroneous Conception of Reproduction on an Increasing Scale
Classical economists made a fundamental error by thinking that accumulation consists only in spending surplus-value on hiring additional productive workers. They reduced all capital to variable capital, ignoring the reproduction of constant capital (means of production). Accumulation transforms surplus-value into both new machinery and new labour-power. Adam Smith’s confusion leads to a distorted view of society’s total capital. Correctly understanding reproduction requires distinguishing physical reproduction from money circulation.
- - -
Classical economists have an ambiguous view of accumulation, they try to differentiate: (1) Productive consumption (consumption by workers who create value) & (2) Unproductive consumption (consumption by landlords, servants, retainers). They wanted to emphasize that accumulation requires surplus-value to be used productively, not wasted in luxury. This made political sense in their struggle against aristocratic parasitism, however they conflated the surplus-value being used to hire workers with accumulation as such, creating massive conceptual errors.
They had to fight two popular misconceptions:
	(1) Confusing accumulation with hoarding money: Some imagined that accumulating capital means withdrawing money from circulation. But capital is only capital when it circulates and valorizes itself. Hoarding destroys capital and freezes value, it doesn't accumulate.
	(2) Confusing capitalist saving with storing up goods: Popular thought imagines that accumulation is storing goods and wealth exist in the forms of physical piles of stuff out of circulation. But physical hoarding generally signals circulation blockages or overproduction, not accumulation. 
Classical economists rightly pushed back against this, but then fell into their own errors.
Adam Smith’s fundamental mistake was identifying all accumulation with wage-payments. He argued that the entire surplus product used for accumulation is consumed by productive workers, and therefore all accumulated surplus-value becomes wages (variable capital). This leads to the conclusion that society’s total capital is nothing but wages. Constant capital (machines, raw materials) disappears conceptually and all capital resolves into variable capital. This is absurd as capitalist does not just buy labour-power, he must buy means of production. Surplus-value splits into constant and variable parts, just like the original capital. Smith collapses these two by following the money instead of following value.
Smith’s "and so on…" argument supposes that every seller uses all income to hire labour, so all capital ultimately becomes wages. This evades the actual question "Where does the constant capital come from? How are machines, raw materials, and inputs reproduced year after year?" Smith stops the chain of reasoning at the point where it becomes difficult. Reproduction must be understood in physical terms, not just monetary flows. Every year’s product must include: replacement of used-up means of production, production of new means of production (for expansion), and production of means of subsistence (for workers). Smith ignores the reproduction of constant capital, so his theory collapses.
The Physiocra's Tableau Economique correctly depicted: the annual reproduction of society, the flows between classes, and the role of the agricultural surplus in maintaining continuity.
## 3. Division of Surplus-Value into Capital and Revenue. The Abstinence Theory
Surplus-value is split between capitalist consumption and capitalist accumulation. The capitalist is compelled by competition to accumulate, turning him into capital personified, whose mission is to expand value endlessly. Historical capitalists often mixed ascetic saving with luxury consumption, generating internal contradictions. Vulgar economists, to justify the capitalist’s role, invented the abstinence theory, claiming capital is created by the capitalist’s moral renunciation of consumption. This is ideological nonsense: capital is created by unpaid labour, not abstinence. Other societies grow without such a class, proving abstinence is not the source of accumulation.
- - -
Surplus-value has two uses and a capitalist must choose what to do with surplus-value:
	Consume it personally (revenue, luxury, comfort)
	Reinvest it (accumulation, expansion)
	The division is an act of the capitalist’s will, but constrained by competition.
There is a distinction between the capitalist as an individual human being with personal desires and the capitalist as the personification of capital, where he is compelled to accumulate, driven to expand and must reinvest surplus-value to survive competition. Accumulation is not a personal virtue; it is a structural necessity.
Capital has a progressive side, the capitalist forces society into large-scale production. He drives technological advancement. He creates the material conditions for a future non-capitalist society. But only as a function of capital, not as a moral hero.
The Faustian contradiction of the capitalist: "Accumulate! But also enjoy!"
	Early capitalists were nearly ascetic: lived simply, saved aggressively, reinvested nearly everything. 
	Later capitalists: credit and speculation generate sudden fortunes. lavish lifestyle becomes a sign of status. luxury is used to secure credit and social standing.
Nassau Senior invents a new ideological trick: That Capital is the result of abstinence. The capitalist abstains from consuming his wealth for the greater good. This is obviously silly: All surplus-value comes from unpaid labour, Not consuming stolen goods is not abstinence. The capitalist’s sacrifice is merely withholding luxury consumption so that he can extract even more labour from workers. Senior transforms exploitation into a moral virtue.
	Vulgar economics is replacing analysis with moral pleading, treating capitalist accumulation as a noble act. This converts economic exploitation into an ethical narrative and claims capital is created by capitalist restraint, not by workers surplus labour. It is a propaganda device, not a theory.
Accumulation in fact historically predates the capitalist. Many societies expand production without capitalists. Peasant societies reproduce and grow without abstinence. Ancient, feudal, and Asian societies increase production without capitalist accumulation. Capitalist accumulation is not a universal human activity; it is a specific social relation disguised as moral necessity.
## 4. Circumstances (other than the surplus-value split) that determine the extent of accumulation
The scale of accumulation depends on everything that increases the mass of surplus-value: intensifying exploitation, reducing wages, lengthening the working day, using nature as a free resource, raising labour productivity, and benefiting from science, technology, and the growing difference between capital employed and capital consumed. Capital gains an expanding power that surpasses the limits of its initial size. Given a fixed percentage of surplus-value going to accumulation, what determines how much capital gets accumulated? Everything that determines the total mass of surplus-value in society.
- - -
Surplus-value increases when exploitation increases by pushing wages toward the mathematical limit of zero. This is done by demonizing workers consumption of small luxuries, advocating extremely cheap diets and supplementing wages with parish relief (lowering the actual wage below subsistence). The working class’s necessary consumption-fund is thereby converted into capital accumulation. Reducing wages below the value of labour-power becomes an active method of increasing accumulation.
Capitalists can increase total labour-hours without proportionally expanding constant capital (machinery/tools), this results in increased surplus-value with minimal new capital advance. Surplus labour can grow faster than constant capital, boosting accumulation.
In extractive industries (mining, fishing, quarrying): Raw materials != capital (they are given by nature). Only instruments of labour count as constant capital. More labour can be added (second shift, third shift) without adding new constant capital. Capital expands by simply pressing labour harder.
Agriculture: increased labour intensity without more tools. Once seed and manure are supplied: intensified labour (more hours, harder work) can significantly raise output, this increases surplus-product without requiring new machinery. Thus labour-power + land gives capital a free expansion capacity.
Higher productivity gives capital an expansionary power independent of its existing magnitude, and allows it to raise accumulation through several channels: 
	(1) More product per worker -> larger physical surplus. Even with the same rate of exploitation, the mass of surplus-value increases.
	(2) Cheapening of commodities raises surplus-value rate. Real wages may rise, but never as fast as productivity, thus workers share falls relatively and capitalists appropriate a rising portion of the social product.
	(3) Productivity improves both new and existing capital. Old machines, when replaced, are replaced by cheaper but more efficient ones. New science turns waste into raw materials, allowing capital to acquire "free gifts" from science and technology. Productivity includes the free cooperation of nature and past labour
As accumulation grows, more and more capital takes the form of long-lasting machinery, buildings, systems of infrastructure. These items transfer value slowly, and therefore parts of capital function as free natural forces, enabling larger output without proportionally more value being consumed. This inflates the scale of production relative to the capital actually worn out. 
The magnitude of capital advanced: More capital → more workers → more surplus-value. Larger capitals multiply accumulation. The capitalist can live luxuriously and still accumulate more: consumption and accumulation can expand together.
## 5. The So-Called Labour Fund
The Labour Fund is the idea that society has a fixed, pre-given portion of capital set aside for wages that cannot be enlarged; Wages must be drawn from this fixed pool. This is nonsensical:
- - -
Capital is not fixed: it is elastic. Capital changes constantly depending on the division of surplus-value. Labour, land, and science give capital an elastic capacity to grow. Productivity, circulation, and exploitation change its scale. Therefore no fixed wage fund could exist.
The dogma falsely treats variable capital as a naturally limited portion of wealth. Bentham and others treat wages as a special, naturally bounded pool, but variable capital is not a natural category, It is just a portion of surplus-value that the capitalist decides to spend on wages rather than on luxuries.
The theory also obscures class power, The wage fund theory states: Workers cannot influence how much of society’s wealth is allocated to wages, bt capitalists are free to devote more or less to wages depending on exploitation strategies. This naturalizes class domination.
Workers wages are not fixed by nature but by class struggle. The actual limits are the minimum physiological subsistence, the social norms of living standards, and the level of organization and bargaining power. All are historical and elastic, not natural.
Fawcett argues that the wage fund is  circulating capital, and average wages = wage fund ÷ number of workers. But if you defined the wage fund as the sum of all wages paid, then that would mean that this sum limits wages. This is a tautology disguised as a law.
Economists claim the wage fund is fixed, yet most English surplus-value was being exported to foreign countries as capital investments. This 'fund' therefore changes constantly, Its size is a matter of capitalist choice, not nature. 
The wage fund doctrine merely just exist to justify low wages and blames workers for demanding more.
