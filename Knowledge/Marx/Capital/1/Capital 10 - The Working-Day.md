## 1. The Limits Of The Working Day
The working day is composed of a necessary portion, in which the worker produces the value of their own labor-power, and a surplus portion, which produces unpaid labor or surplus-value for the capitalist. 
While the necessary labor-time is fixed, the total working day is variable, limited only by physical and social constraints, and can therefore be extended or shortened. 
The capitalist, seeking to maximize surplus-value, has an interest in prolonging the working day, while the worker, as the seller of labour-power, has an interest in limiting it to a normal, sustainable length so they can preserve their strength and continue reproducing their labor-power. 
Because both parties have rights under the law of commodity exchange, the determination of the working day becomes a struggle between capital and labor, with force and social conditions ultimately deciding the outcome.
## 2. The Voracious Appetite For Surplus Labour. Manufacturer And Boyar
Capitalists have a voracious drive to extract surplus labour beyond the necessary labour-time required to reproduce the worker’s labour-power. This drive is inherent in the system and not unique to modern capitalism, it has existed historically wherever a class had a monopoly over the means of production.
In pre-capitalist systems like slavery, serfdom, and corvee, surplus labour was visibly separate from necessary labour, while under capitalism it is mingled with necessary labour and hidden in the working day.
Legal regulations attempt to limit the working day and protect workers, but capitalists often circumvent these limits through small increments of overwork, 'snatching minutes' from meal or rest periods, which cumulatively generate significant extra profit.
Crises and downturns in trade do not stop the extraction of surplus labour; in fact, they often intensify the pressure to extend work-time to maintain profits.
The worker is treated purely as personified labour-time, with distinctions reduced to categories like full-timers and half-timers, reflecting the commodification of labour-power.
The accumulation of surplus-value is not secret, it is built systematically through the control of working hours and the minute exploitation of the worker’s labour-time.
## 3. Branches Of English Industry Without Legal Limits To Exploitation
Certain industries remained largely unregulated, allowing extreme exploitation of workers. Examples include the lace trade, pottery, match-making, wallpaper printing, baking, millinery, and blacksmithing.
Children as young as 6–10 years worked 12–15 hours per day, often without proper breaks for meals or rest. Overwork led to physical degeneration, stunted growth, early death, and disease.
Adult workers endured long hours (up to 16–30 hours continuously in peak seasons), poor ventilation, dangerous environments, and insufficient sleep, this caused premature aging, illness, and high mortality rates.
Capitalist profit motives drove overwork regardless of human cost. Employers extended working hours, ignored health and safety, and treated workers’ labour as a commodity to maximize surplus-value. Competition among masters further intensified labour exploitation.
Factory Acts and public inquiries existed but were often circumvented or poorly enforced. Legal restrictions or public attention only partially mitigated exploitation; in some sectors, overwork persisted with almost no regulation.
Long hours, dangerous working conditions, and lack of rest physically weakened workers, caused chronic illness, and shortened life expectancy. The capitalist system systematically converted human labour-power into a consumable resource, disregarding human health and social well-being.
## 4. Day-work And Night-work, The Shift-system
Capital seeks to exploit labour continuously to maximize surplus value. Machinery and factories are only valuable insofar as they extract labour; idle equipment represents a loss. This drives the extension of production to 24 hours, including night-work.
Shift systems are used to overcome physical limits of individual workers. Alternating day and night shifts allows continuous operation without overexerting the same workers. This system was prominent in the English cotton industry and persists in metallurgical industries (steel, iron, rolling mills, forges).
Children and adolescents were heavily exploited in night-work. Boys as young as 6–9 years worked long hours, sometimes in back-to-back day and night shifts. Reports describe extreme cases: multiple 12–18 hour shifts, sleep deprivation, and severe physical strain.
Employers justified night-work for economic reasons, not worker welfare. Owners and managers claimed night-work of boys was necessary to maintain profits, reduce costs, and train apprentices. Restrictions on night-work were framed as financially impractical, even though only a small proportion of workers were children. Adult men were said to depend on children to share night labour, further rationalizing exploitation.
The 24-hour production cycle prioritizes capital over human health. Machinery and furnaces are valued over workers’ rest; interruptions in work are considered economic losses. Night-work allows continuous absorption of labour, enhancing profits while disregarding physical or moral consequences.
Cynical rationalizations highlight the systemic nature of exploitation. Employers openly acknowledge that labour laws or moral considerations are secondary to profit. Night-work and child labour are maintained as part of the economic logic of continuous production, not for necessity or training.
## 5. The Struggle For A Normal Working Day. Laws For The Compulsory Extension Of The Working Day, From The Middle Of The Fourteenth To The End Of The Seventeenth Century
Capital seeks to consume the entire labour-power of workers, ignoring their health, moral development, or rest. Workers’ meals, sleep, and free time are subordinated to production; the working day is determined by maximum labour output, not the worker’s well-being. This produces physical exhaustion, premature aging, and reduced life expectancy, similar to overworked machines.
Like slaves, workers’ lives are expendable; the capitalist is concerned only with extracting maximum labour while their replacement is available. Overwork and early death are normalized as long as there is a steady supply of new labour.
Population surpluses in urban and industrial areas provided a continuous supply of workers to replace those weakened or killed by overwork. Even industries with high mortality were continuously staffed, showing capitalism’s disregard for the worker’s life.
From the 14th to 17th centuries, the state often legislated to lengthen the working day to secure more surplus labour, reflecting early capital’s need to enforce its economic power. Early statutes attempted to fix wages and extend working hours for craftsmen and labourers, often much longer than modern standards.
Some observers (like Postlethwayt) argued workers were lazy and needed compulsion to work six days a week; others defended workers’ limited labour as supporting skill, ingenuity, and well-being. Attempts to enforce long working hours, through ideal workhouses or legal regulation, exemplify early capitalist efforts to institutionalize exploitation.
Over centuries, legislation slowly limited child and youth labour. Factories became the realized House of Terror envisioned in capitalist theory, turning the earlier idea of workhouses for paupers into a system of industrialized exploitation for all workers.
## 6. The Struggle For A Normal Working Day. Laws For The Compulsory Limitation Of Working Hours, the English Factory Legislation Of 1833–64
Before the late 18th century, capital gradually extended working hours up to the natural limit of ~12 hours. With large-scale industry, working hours became excessive and unregulated, often ignoring age, sex, or day/night boundaries. Early labor laws (1802–1833) were mostly symbolic and unenforced; child labor remained extreme. 
The legislative progress was slow, partial, and often resisted by capital. Full regulation of the working day developed incrementally over 50 years, starting with child labor and extending to women and eventually adult males.
**The Factory Act of 1833** Introduced the first legal regulation of working hours in cotton, wool, flax, and silk factories and limited child labor and compulsory meal breaks. Capital exploited loopholes: implemented relay system with shifts of children to maintain long production hours without technically breaking the law.
**Subsequent reforms (1844, 1847)**
	**1844 Factory Act:** Extended protections to women, reduced children’s hours, standardized meal breaks, tried to abolish the relay system. 
	**1847 Ten Hours’ Act:** Gradually reduced working day for young persons and women to 10 hours.
	Manufacturers resisted: wage cuts, manipulation of work hours, reintroduction of relays, legal challenges, and evasion tactics.
Factory inspectors struggled to enforce laws due to complex relay systems and evasions. Courts often sided with manufacturers, rendering some provisions ineffective. Incremental improvements eventually succeeded due to persistent working-class pressure and growing political support.
By 1850–1853, laws gradually regulated the working day for most workers in industry: Children, young persons, and women had regulated hours and meal times. Relay system mostly abolished.
## 7. The Struggle For A Normal Working Day. Impact Of The English Factory Legislation On Other Countries
Capital seeks to extend the working day as far as possible, particularly in industries first transformed by machinery. This drive leads to extreme exploitation, especially of minors and women, creating the need for legal regulation.
Early laws, like the English Factory Acts, initially appeared as exceptions but gradually became the norm as industrial methods spread. The regulation of work hours emerges from prolonged conflict between capital and labor.
English factory workers were pioneers in fighting for a normal working day. Their struggle set the precedent for international labor movements. English factory legislation was slow, incremental, and partial, often focusing on children, minors, and women first before extending to all workers.
**France:** Adopted a 12-hour law after the February Revolution; it applied universally but had loopholes. Unlike England, it imposed limits on all workers immediately.
**United States:** Slavery delayed the development of labor movements, but after the Civil War, an eight-hour workday became a central demand. The International Workingmen’s Association also endorsed eight hours as a universal legal limit.
The labor market illusion of freedom is revealed: selling labor-power does not mean freedom, the capitalist can exploit the worker for the full available time. Legal limits on working hours become a necessary protection against total exploitation.
Limiting the working day is foundational for any broader social reform or workers emancipation. Without such limits, attempts to improve conditions are doomed.
