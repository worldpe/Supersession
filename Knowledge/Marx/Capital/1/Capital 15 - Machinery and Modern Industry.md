## 1. The Development of Machinery
Machinery develops historically from tools and becomes the basis of large-scale industry. Machines transform the labor process and subordinate workers to an automated industrial mechanism designed to extract more surplus value. Machinery requires and produces its own industrial foundation, reshaping all interconnected branches of production.
Under capitalism, machinery hasn’t reduced human toil. Machinery’s purpose is to increase surplus value by: Cheapening commodities, shortening the portion of the working day during which the worker reproduces the value of their own wage, & lengthening the unpaid portion (surplus labor time).
- - -
A tool becomes a machine when the tool formerly held and moved by a worker becomes: a component of a mechanism, detached from human bodily limits, driven by a motive power independent of human muscle.
The industrial revolution began with innovations in the working machine, the direct successor to the craftsman’s tools.
1. Motor mechanism (source of motion: steam, water, wind)
2. Transmitting mechanism (gears, wheels, belts distributing motion)
3. Working machine (the tool now integrated into a mechanical apparatus)
The working parts of machines are repurposed craft tools (spindles, needles, saw-blades). Machines can bring far more tools into simultaneous operation than any human can. This breaks the natural bodily limits of how many implements one worker can manipulate.
	Example: A spinner cannot operate two wheels simultaneously; a Jenny spins 12–18 spindles; a modern loom uses thousands of needles. Machines massively scale up the quantitative output of the tool, independent of human bodily structure.
In hand production: The worker both operates the tool and powers it (foot powering a spinning wheel), but once the tool becomes part of a mechanism, the worker becomes a simple prime mover (furnishing muscle power). At this point, humans can be replaced by natural forces (water, wind, steam). This makes human physical strength irrelevant to the process; the labor process is reorganized around mechanical needs, not bodily ones.
Early steam engines did not revolutionize production, new machines merely drove the development of better steam engines, especially Watt’s double-acting engine (1784). This engine: Provided a steady, controllable, mobile, urban, universal source of power, allowed production to move into towns, eliminated dependence on local water supply, became universally applicable across industries, thus the steam engine created the real conditions for factory-based machine production.
At first, machinery consists of single machines performing all operations. Then two levels of cooperation arise:
- Cooperation of many identical machines: Example: a factory hall full of power-looms. They share a common prime mover and transmitting system. This is like a machine-organism where multiple identical organs share a circulatory system. 
- A system of differentiated, sequential machines: The product passes continuously through a series of machines, each performing a specialized phase. The division of labor of manufacture is now embodied in machines. The process becomes objective, structured by engineering requirements rather than the skills of craftsmen. This is when machinery becomes a mechanical system, not isolated tools.
The system becomes more perfect as the production process becomes unbroken, raw material flows continuously without human transfer. Human intervention becomes an interruption rather than a necessity. Continuity is the principle of the factory. This is the origin of the **automatic factory**.
An automatic system exists when machines perform all essential motions autonomously, & workers merely supervise, correct, and maintain motion.
	Examples include: Self-acting mules, self-stopping looms, machines that correct for breaks in the process, this is the maturation of the machine system.
Originally machines were built by skilled craftsmen, and this limited the expansion of machine industries (machines made by hand are expensive, slow to produce, and rely on scarce skilled labor). But as machine-making splits into many specialized branches. Manufacture provides the technical foundation for machine construction. Eventually, the handicraft and manufacturing foundations become insufficient; they cannot produce components large or precise enough for modern machinery. This creates a technical contradiction: large-scale industry relies on a machine system fabricated by pre-industrial tools. The contradiction forces the mechanization of machine-production itself and the rise of heavy industry, steel, iron, hydraulic presses, etc.
Machinery revolutionizes interconnected industries, a revolution in one branch forces revolution in related branches:
	Machine-spinning → machine-weaving
	Both → chemical/mechanical revolutions in bleaching, dyeing, printing
	Cotton-spinning → invention of the cotton gin, etc.
	Thus industrial transformation occurs in clusters, not isolated sectors.
## 2. The Value Transferred By The Machinery To The Product
Machines do not create new value at all; they merely gradually pass on it's value already contained in them. Their effectiveness depends on replacing more labor than it costs to build, capitalists care only about the price of labor-power (wages), not the total human labor saved, machinery is adopted or rejected based on profitability, which can lead to perverse outcomes in which barbaric human labor persists because it is cheaper than machines. Ultimately, machinery becomes a force of nature within production, but under capitalism it also becomes a tool for cheapening labor and wasting human life.
- - -
Machines enter production physically as whole units, but they enter value-wise only slowly, according to their wear and tear. The longer and more durably a machine lasts, the smaller the daily amount of value it transfers. This makes the gap between its physical use and its contribution to value especially large compared to simple tools.
Once you subtract a machine’s daily depreciation and the cost of things like oil and coal, the machine’s contribution to value becomes very small compared to the huge amount of physical output it helps produce. Machinery increasingly resembles natural forces(steam, gravity, magnetism) which cost nothing but massively increase productivity.
Because modern machines handle many tools (spindles, looms, hammers) and work faster than any hand tool, the small value they shed each day is divided across massive quantities of product, making the value added per unit extremely small.
Cheaper machinery → smaller value transfer → greater productivity
	The less labor required to build a machine, the less value it contains, and so the less value it transfers. The goal of machinery production is to reduce the machine's cost so that it transfers as little value as possible relative to how much labor it replaces. This is why products made by machine may contain a higher proportion of value coming from machinery relative to human labor, but an absolutely smaller amount of value from machinery than the hand-produced equivalent.
A machine is economically useful only if: 
	The value it adds to each unit is less than.
	The value previously added by human labor it replaces.
	If the labor to build a machine equals the labor the machine replaces (then productivity has not increased, labor has merely been shifted).
A crucial distinction:
	Machines contain all the labor required to build them.
	Wages represent only the labor workers perform for themselves (necessary labor), not the total labor they perform.
	Even when a machine costs as much in money as a year of wages for the workers it displaces, it still represents far less total labor than those workers previously contributed.
	This is why machinery almost always replaces more labor in reality than it appears to do in wage terms.
Even if a machine is technically more efficient, a capitalist will adopt it only if the cost of machine is lower than the cost of labor-power it replaces or if this produces major variations between countries and industries. Where wages are high, machinery spreads rapidly; Where wages are low, machinery may not be used even when technically superior.
	This explains:
		Why machines invented in one country may be used elsewhere first.
		Why England produced machines used in America but not at home.
		Why French inventions were often adopted first in England.
		Why extremely exploitative industries (stone-breaking, child labor, women hauling barges) continued despite available machinery: labor was so cheap that machines weren’t "worth it" to capitalists.
When machines produce a surplus labor force, wages fall. Lower wages can make machinery less profitable in other industries, since the cheap labor reduces the incentive to mechanize.
Workers are often used instead of machines, even where the work is brutal and degrading, because maintaining surplus workers costs almost nothing. England, the center of modern machinery, also became the center of the most shameless waste of human labor.
## 3. The Most Immediate Effects Of Machine Production On The Worker 
Machinery enables capitalists to employ women and children on a massive scale,  dissolving the traditional family structure and spreading the value of labour-power across the whole family. This increases exploitation, destroys the appearance of a free labour contract, and produces profound physical, moral, and intellectual degradation. Machinery also becomes the most powerful instrument for lengthening the working day: its enormous cost, susceptibility to obsolescence, and dependence on continuous labour compel capitalists to keep it running as long as possible. The result is extended labour hours far beyond natural limits.
- - -
Machinery transforms who can be employed and expands exploitation because machinery reduces the need for muscular strength, it allows capitalists to hire those previously unable to perform heavy labour: women and children.
The entire working-class family becomes subject to direct capitalist exploitation. The family wage disappears: the father’s wage is diluted because the value of labour-power spreads across the work of all family members. The family must collectively supply more surplus labour than before, since more people are working.
What looked like a free exchange between independent individuals becomes  the worker selling not just himself, but also his wife and children, a form of slave-dealing. Capital buys children outright, sometimes through markets resembling slave auctions. Factory owners require children who look old enough, and doctors often falsify ages to satisfy capital’s needs. Capital thus destroys the appearance of freedom in the wage contract.
Where capital employs married women industrially, child death rates skyrocket: Machinery produces high infant mortality, especially in districts where women work long hours away from home. Neglect, malnutrition, and use of opiates to quiet infants becomes widespread. Psychological estrangement between mothers and children appears. In some agricultural districts where gang-labour for women is common, the same factory-like abuses appear.
Machinery replaces skill with automatic processes, reducing children to: Living appendages of machines, robbed of mental development. Not "naturally ignorant", but artificially stunted by capital. Even Parliament recognizes the danger and introduces compulsory education clauses, but the education laws are a sham. Schools packed with children doing nothing but sitting in a room with schoolmasters who cannot read or write. Paperwork fraudulently filled out to satisfy nominal requirements. Hours made up in bizarre, fragmented schedules that destroy continuity of learning. Manufacturers oppose education because educated children are harder to exploit.
By flooding the labour market with women and children, machinery undermines traditional male craft resistance and creates a more compliant, dependent workforce. This makes labour cheaper, more abundant, and more easily disciplined. The introduction of machinery is therefore a political weapon of the capitalist class.
Machinery could shorten necessary labour time, but capitalists use it to lengthen the working day instead.
1.  Machinery wants to run constantly. Machines cost a lot and wear out both through use and non-use. They lose value (moral depreciation) as new machines are invented and must produce as much as possible before becoming obsolete. Thus the capitalist has every incentive to keep machines running endlessly. 
2. If a machine runs 16 hours, it produces twice as many commodities as at 8 hours, therefore each commodity carries less of the machine’s value. Surplus-value is realized more quickly and capitalists must lengthen working time when machines are new.
3. When only a few firms have machines their individual productivity is high. They sell at the old social value to pocket the difference. This creates a frenzy to squeeze machines for all they’re worth, increase hours, and extract maximum profit while the monopoly lasts.
4. Lengthening the day produces more output without buying more machines or buildings and increases surplus-value while keeping costs down. This intensifies the capitalist drive to extend the working day beyond all natural limits.
## 4. The Factory
The factory is the perfected form of capitalist production, where machinery dominates workers and reorganizes labor entirely. Skill and control are transferred from the worker to the system of machines, collapsing traditional divisions of labor while enabling an intensified regime of exploitation, discipline, and surveillance. Workers become interchangeable appendages of the automatic machinery, subordinated to an environment that increases productivity by degrading their bodies, skills, and autonomy. In the factory, capitalist control over the labor process reaches its fullest technical and social expression.
- - -
Machinery not only replaces tools, it reorganizes production so deeply that the worker becomes a mere appendage of the machine. Skill, control, and the impetus of work shift from human beings to the mechanical system itself. This strips labor of autonomy, content, and continuity with earlier forms of handicraft or manufacture.
In theory, the factory is collective cooperation of workers with machinery, but in practice, the machine is THE subject, the workers its living organs. This presents an inversion: the machine is like a slave master, and the worker is like a servant, this is the defining feature of the capitalist factory.
Machinery destroys the technical basis for the manufacture-era division of labor, by transferring skill into the machine, large-scale industry eliminates the need for highly differentiated workers. Skill hierarchies collapse, replaced by differences of age and sex, since the main requirement is simply the ability to follow the machine’s motion.
Division of labor persists only as a technical distribution of people to machines, the factory does not require the stable, craft-based divisions of manufacture. Workers can be shifted or replaced at will, and tasks can be learned very quickly. This enables:
	Constant turnover of labor,
	Use of children as machine attendants,
	The relay system (workers swapped in and out with no pause in production).
Capital reintroduces division of labor artificially to exploit workers more deeply. Even though machinery technically abolishes the old division of labor, capital reinstates it in a degraded form: life-long servitude to a single machine. This reduces training costs and intensifies workers dependence on the factory.
The worker’s motions no longer guide the tool; the machine dictates every motion. The factory becomes a lifeless mechanism commanding living labor, workers lose even the minimal control and mixed activity they had under manufacture, labor becomes monotonous, exhausting, and devoid of content.
Large-scale industry seals the complete separation of conception and execution. Intellectual aspects of production (planning, scientific knowledge, design) shift fully to capital. Workers lose skill and become interchangeable, while knowledge becomes a power exercised over them, embodied in machinery and management.
The factory introduces a barracks-like discipline, enforced through fines, supervision, and a factory code written unilaterally by the capitalist. This code functions as a private legal system without responsibility, representation, or rights. The factory hierarchy splits workers into: Machine operators and attendants, Overseers & A small technical elite (engineers, mechanics)
The material conditions of factory labor are systematically harmful (excess heat, dust, noise, overcrowding of machines), and this injures every sense organ and consistently produces severe accidents. The capitalist pursuit of economy results in depriving workers of space, light, air and safety while squeezing out the maximum possible output.
Factories resemble mitigated jails because machinery, discipline, and the labor environment confine and exhaust workers physically and mentally.
## 5. The Struggle Between Worker And Machine 
Machinery transforms the struggle between workers and capital into a direct conflict between workers and the means of production itself. Machines displace labor, create permanent unemployment, intensify exploitation, and become capital’s most effective weapon against worker resistance. Machinery materializes the antagonism of the capitalist system and deepens the subjugation of labor.
- - -
Before machinery, the worker’s struggle was against capitalists over wages and conditions, but with the advent of machinery, the worker struggles against the means of production itself, because machines embody capital’s domination in material form. Machinery becomes the visible enemy.
	17th–18th centuries: destruction of looms, sawmills, wool-shearing machines.
	Early 19th century: Luddite movement against power-looms.
Workers saw machines as direct competitors destroying their livelihoods. Only gradually did workers learn to distinguish: the machine as a technical tool, from the machine as used by capital to dominate labor. This learning process is historically significant: political consciousness develops through these conflicts.
Under manufacture workers’ tasks were subdivided, but human labor remained central. Division of labor supplemented a small labor supply; it didn’t replace masses of workers. Displacement under early manufacturing was modest and mainly affected guild masters, not wage laborers: Machinery, by contrast, directly replaces human labor on a large scale.
Machinery directly throws workers out of employment. When a machine takes over a worker’s specialized tool-handling: The worker’s skill loses value, their labor-power becomes unsellable, and the worker becomes redundant. Machinery creates permanent unemployment, swelling the reserve army of labor. This is not hypothetical displacement (millions of workers who never existed); it is actual, immediate job loss, for example, power-looms replaced 800,000 hand-weavers.
Displacement can be acute or chronic, but machinery creates a mechanism of ongoing misery, regardless of pace: 
	Gradual adoption → chronic, prolonged degradation (e.g. English handloom weavers)
	Rapid adoption → sudden mass ruin (e.g. Indian weavers)
	But both result in: permanent unemployment, falling wages due to oversupply of labor, and intensified competition among workers.
Machinery intensifies the antagonistic character of capitalist production.
	Capital appears ever more as an alien, hostile power.
	The worker confronts their own labor turned against them.
	The antagonism shifts from partial or episodic to total and structural.
	**Machinery is the moment where the worker begins to revolt against the entire system of production, not just conditions.**
Even within fully mechanized industries, improvements continually displace labor. Even after initial mechanization, continuous innovation reduces the need for both skilled and unskilled labor, substitutes children and women for men, speeds up processes, and raises productivity with fewer workers.
	Example: Post–American Civil War improvements in English cotton industry: 338 factories vanish due to consolidation; Power-looms decrease yet yield more; Spindles increase; Workforce shrinks by 50,000. Machinery constantly revolutionizes itself, and each revolution destroys jobs.
Machinery becomes capital’s strategic weapon against worker resistance. It is used to: break strikes, bypass skilled workers, reduce bargaining power, and replace workers who demand better conditions. Inventions like the self-acting mule were adopted partly to suppress the refractory skilled spinners. Machines were explicitly introduced to defeat worker power, the whole class of skilled workers is done away with. Machinery is therefore both a productive force, and a tool of labor discipline and repression.
Bourgeois theorists openly celebrate machinery as a means of disciplining workers. Andrew Ure as the ideological mouthpiece of capital:
	Machines enforce docility in labor. Strikes justify further mechanization. Science is enlisted against workers. Long hours, child labor, and low wages are beneficial. 
		Ure’s writing reveals the ideological logic of the factory system: Machines are not neutral; they are instruments of capitalist control.
## 6. The Compensation Theory, With Regard To The Workers Displaced By Machinery 
Machinery does not automatically create new jobs for the workers it displaces. Instead, it converts wages into machinery, expands the reserve army of labor, lowers demand for basic goods, and spreads unemployment to other industries. Any new jobs that do arise result from **new capital**, not from the capital that previously employed the dismissed workers. Machinery itself could lighten labor, but under capitalism it becomes a tool for intensifying exploitation. While production expands, employment does not keep pace; new industries and luxury consumption grow, but a vast servant class and surplus population grow even faster. The compensation theory is an ideological defense of capitalist relations, not an actual process within them. Machine production accelerates the division of labor, multiplies branches of industry, intensifies global trade, increases luxury consumption by the ruling class, and creates an enormous servant class. The cumulative effect is not the harmonious self-correction promised by economists, but the expansion of a relative surplus population of workers who can be drawn into cheap, unstable, auxiliary work or simply discarded.
- - -
**Compensation Theory:** When machinery displaces workers, the capitalist system automatically and necessarily creates enough new jobs to reabsorb those same workers. This claim is both economically false and ideologically deceptive.
When machinery replaces labor, a portion of capital that used to be spent on wages is transformed into capital tied up in machines. This conversion from variable capital (which buys labor-power) to constant capital (which buys machinery) means that less of the total capital is available to employ workers. Machinery does not set free capital for wages; it freezes variable capital into constant capital. If the machinery costs significantly less than the labor it replaces, a small portion of capital may be left over, but nowhere near enough to rehire the displaced workers.
"Even if dismissed workers lose their jobs, the means of subsistence they previously consumed are now set free and become available to fund new wages elsewhere."
	Those means of subsistence were never capital in the first place, rather they were commodities bought by the workers with their wages. When workers lose their jobs, they simply stop buying those commodities. This lowers demand, depresses prices, and can lead to layoffs in other industries that produce those subsistence goods. Machinery does not free up capital to hire displaced workers elsewhere; it creates unemployment not only in the mechanized industry but in other industries as falling demand ripples outward.
The real effect of machinery is that displaced workers are forced onto the labor market, increasing the supply of labor-power available for exploitation. This creates a reserve army of labor that depresses wages and strengthens capital’s bargaining power. Even when some of these workers eventually find employment, it is not because the capital previously used to employ them has returned to hire them again. It is because entirely new capital, seeking new opportunities for profit, expands into other sectors. Displaced workers are narrowly skilled for their old tasks, and are often forced into lower-paid, oversupplied, degraded forms of work. Many never find stable employment again, especially during the long transitional periods that follow mechanization.
The misery produced by machinery is not due to machinery itself but to the capitalist way it is used. Machinery in principle could lighten labor and shorten the working day. But under capitalism it lengthens working hours, intensifies labor, and cheapens workers’ skills. Economists obscure this by pretending that since machinery, in itself, is a neutral improvement, the social effects generated by its capitalist use are mere misunderstandings or temporary inconveniences. In doing so, they shift blame away from the profit system and toward an abstract machine, just as a murderer might blame his knife while insisting that society must not abolish knives.
Machinery can stimulate employment in other sectors for example, in the industries that produce machines, metals, coal, and raw materials. It can also lead to new types of work, new transportation needs, and new luxury industries. But the fundamental purpose of machinery in capitalism is to reduce the labor necessary to produce goods. Even when overall production multiplies, far fewer workers are needed relative to the scale of output. And the new industries are often small, unstable, or reliant on the simplest forms of manual labor. The number of people employed as servants, a vast class of modern domestic slaves, expands enormously. Increased productivity ironically expands unproductive, servile occupations rather than creative or liberating ones.
## 7. Repulsion And Attraction Of Workers Through The Development Of Machine Production. Crises In The Cotton Industry
Machinery simultaneously displaces workers and draws them back in through expanded factory production, but always in a way that makes labor relatively less essential and more precarious. Large-scale industry creates cycles of boom and crisis, restructuring global production and repeatedly throwing workers into unemployment, misery, and turbulence. The English cotton industry illustrates this process in its purest form, with workers continuously repelled and attracted as capital expands, competes, and restructures itself.
- - -
Machinery absolutely displaces workers in the handicraft/manufacturing sector it invades, but factory employment can later expand due to industrial growth, even while relative employment falls.
If total capital grows drastically, factories can hire more workers even though each £100 of capital hires fewer, the machine industry can increase worker numbers only because **the total capital grows**, not because the factory becomes more labor-intensive.
Rising factory employment sometimes cimes from absorbing nearby trades (switching carpet looms or ribbon looms from hand-power to steam). The increase is illusory, as it only reflects that many old workers were expelled from other industries.
Women, children, and young persons dominate factory labor, except in metallurgy, so the number of workers hides the fact that adult male employment is undermined even when total headcount grows.
Once machine production reaches maturity the system gains enormous elasticity, and its growth is limited only by the supply of raw materials and the size of markets. This leads to new global dynamics.
large-scale industry restructures the entire world into a system where the industrial centers suck in raw materials produced by subordinated regions. Cheap machine-made goods devastate global handicrafts and have forced: 
	India → to produce raw materials (cotton, jute, hemp, indigo).
	Australia → wool
	Other regions → agricultural production for the industrial core.
Because machinery makes rapid expansions possible, industry becomes bound to the unstable world market.
The result is a repeatable cycle: 1. Expansion 2. Glut 3. Market contraction 4.Crisis 5. Stagnation 6. Recovery 7. Repeat, creating chronic insecurity for workers.
During downturns capitalists introduce more labor-saving machinery and force wage cuts below the value of labor-power. This intensifies exploitation to undercut rivals, so in this way crises accelerate technical change and worsen labor conditions.
Because technical change constantly: Removes workers (repulsion) & Expands factory capacity (attraction), the workforce experiences continuous turbulence: changing skill requirements, gender composition, age structure, and employment status.
The cotton industry is the perfect example:
	Early period (1770–1815): few crises because Britain had a monopoly.
	Later period (1815–1863): intense competition → frequent crises, misery, wage cuts, Lockouts, and class struggle.
The American Civil War’s disrupted the supply of cotton in England, and it showed even catastrophe becomes a means of capitalist restructuring:
	Over half of looms and spindles shut down.
	Drastic wage falls—even on full time, workers lost up to 30–60% wages due to bad cotton.
	Manufacturers reduced piece-rates additionally by 5–10%.
	Rent was deducted from wages, even during short time.
	Experiments with adulterated materials increased worker sickness.
	Prostitution rose sharply from mass unemployment.
	The famine accelerated the destruction of small mills and actually concentrated capital further into centralized hands.
Even during prosperity, adult male workers endure: Long hours, Wage suppression, Employer lockouts, Lengthy strikes, Constant insecurity. Prosperity offers temporary relief, not stability.
## 8. The Revolutionary Impact Of Large-scale Industry On Manufacture, Handicrafts And Domestic Industry
Large-scale industry overturns earlier forms of production (handicrafts, manufacture, and domestic work) by introducing machinery, reorganizing labor, and imposing capitalist discipline. The factory system spreads its logic everywhere, even where machines are not yet dominant, leading to intensified use of women and children as cheap labor. Domestic industry becomes a dispersed but tightly controlled extension of factory production, with the worst conditions of overcrowding, overwork, disease, and exploitation. The contradiction of capitalist efficiency is that it saves materials but ruthlessly wastes human life.
- - - 
Machines directly replace earlier cooperative systems among handicraft workers. Machinery can replace coordinated human labor entirely (ex: The reaping machine replaces the team of coordinated reapers).  And they can supersede manufacture built on the division of labor. (ex: The needle-making machine produces vast quantities at speeds impossible in the old manufacturing system.)
Machines may temporarily coexist with small-scale or handicraft-like production: Small steam engines hired by cottage weavers. Cottage factories in Coventry, where power was delivered to looms in workers homes. However, these are transitional. Mechanization inevitably pushes toward full factory organization, where human muscle is replaced by mechanical motive force (steam, water).
New industries pass briefly through handicraft and manufacturing stages before consolidating into factories. Where many disconnected steps exist (as in early pen-making), machine development is slower, but eventually mechanization prevails.
The logic of machinery spreads to all forms of production, reorganizing labor and degrading work. Factory production revolutionizes not just factory industries, but all other branches.
Scientific decomposition of labor: Even where full machinery is not adopted, manufacture becomes increasingly mechanized process-by-process. The hierarchy of specialized crafts dissolves; fixed divisions of labor become fluid as capital repeatedly restructures production.
Transformation of the collective worker: Factory logic promotes capital to substitutes cheap labour wherever possible. 
This no longer resembles earlier home production based on independent artisans or peasants. It is now: A dispersed extension of the factory. Controlled indirectly through middlemen and piecework systems.
Domestic outwork is the worst of all, workers are scattered, giving them a weak collective resistance. Multiple layers of intermediaries take cuts. Working conditions are unregulated and often miserable (lack of light, ventilation, stable income). Domestic industries must compete with factories, causing wages to be pushed absolute minimum.
Economizing materials is coupled with waste of human bodies, squandering of workers health and life, and this antagonistic character becomes clearer the less technologically advanced the sector.
Large-scale workshops without full machinery rely heavily on children, women, and toxic or exhausting labor.
Domestic industry becomes capital’s most brutal and hidden mode of exploitation, no longer a survival of pre-capitalist life, it exist an appendage of large-scale industry. Performed in Mistresses houses (informal workshops) or Workers homes (usually rented rooms or garrets). Mothers exploit children out of necessity; children in turn abandon parents as soon as possible.
## 9. The Health And Education Clauses Of The Factory Acts. The General Extension Of Factory Legislation In England
Factory legislation becomes necessary because capitalism cannot provide even basic health, safety, or education without being forced to. Large-scale industry destroys old forms of labor and family life, reproduces new forms of exploitation, and simultaneously creates the technological and educational basis for a more developed and varied form of human labor. The contradictions of capitalist production, its brutality toward workers, destructive division of labor, and constant revolutionizing of industrial techniques, drive the expansion of factory regulation and point toward a future society where education, labor, and human development are integrated and no longer subordinated to capital. The 1867 legislation marks a reluctant recognition by the capitalist state that unregulated exploitation is socially ruinous, but the state simultaneously shows its allegiance to capital by undermining the very reforms it passes.
- - -
Factory legislation inevitably expands from controlling working hours into health, safety, and education because the capitalist mode of production is incapable of providing even the most basic conditions for human life without being forced to by law. Even the simplest health measures, such as proper ventilation, whitewashing, and guards on dangerous machinery, must be imposed by the state, and the capital fights bitterly against them, since any measure that costs money or reduces the intensity of exploitation is treated as an attack on profit.
Negligence is catastrophic, for example, Irish scutching mills where women and children suffer horrific mutilations, could have been prevented with very cheap protections. This demonstrates that capital, left to its own devices, is structurally incapable of safeguarding workers lives and health because doing so contradicts the logic of accumulation.
The education clauses of the Factory Acts, although minimal and still weak, introduce compulsory elementary schooling for working children, proving that education can be combined productively with work. Inspectors find that children who alternate between school and labor actually learn more efficiently than middle-class children forced into long, mind-numbing school days. Marx treats this as the germ of a future form of education: the integration of productive labor, intellectual instruction, and physical development: an education aimed at producing fully developed human beings, not specialized fragments.
Capitalism simultaneously destroys such human development. Large-scale industry technically dissolves the narrow, craft-based division of labor inherited from manufacture, yet in its capitalist form it re-imposes an even more degrading division of labor: workers become appendages of machines, and children are confined to mindless tasks that teach them nothing. 
In earlier stages of production, narrow specialization and fragmented skills were historically necessary. But modern industry reveals the fundamental motions and principles behind all labor, dissolving the mystery of trades and enabling the possibility of varied work and broad human development. Modern industry is revolutionary because it constantly transforms production and demands workers capable of a wide range of functions. But under capitalism, this potential becomes a torment: workers are made disposable, constantly threatened with being deskilled, displaced, or rendered obsolete. This contradiction between industry’s need for versatile workers and capitalism’s need for cheap, restricted, interchangeable labor creates massive human suffering but also points beyond capitalism to a future in which varied labor becomes a conscious social principle.
New institutions such as technical schools and vocational training arise spontaneously from large-scale industry, and anticipates that a working-class seizure of political power would use them to reorganize education and abolish the old division of labor. The goal is the fully developed individual who can shift between many forms of labor, instead of being chained to one specialized task for life.
Regulating domestic labour (the labor done in the home or small workshops) reveals that capitalism has already destroyed the material basis of the traditional family. Child labor becomes so brutal and unchecked that children require protection not only from employers but from their own impoverished parents, who are compelled by economic pressure to sell their children’s labor. Capitalism creates the conditions for the dissolution of the old patriarchal family and simultaneously lays the foundation for a higher, more egalitarian form of family life, though in capitalist form this transformation appears as moral degradation and social ruin.
Factory regulation must eventually become universal. As long as only big factories are regulated, capitalists shift exploitation into small workshops, home work, and out of sight of inspectors. Large capitalists end up demanding regulation of small workplaces to equalize competition. The two forces push toward universal factory legislation: capital’s tendency to compensate for restrictions by intensifying exploitation elsewhere, and capitalists own demand for equal competitive conditions.
The Children’s Employment Commission concluded that more than 1.4 million children, young persons, and women should be placed under the Factory Acts. Half of these worked in small industries or so-called domestic workplaces.
There is a 20-year delay between the first shocking revelations (1840–42) and any meaningful legislative action (mid-1860s). Parliament allowed the report to sit ignored for two decades, while a generation of neglected children grew up to raise the next. What changed by the 1860s was the shift in social and political conditions: Working-class organization had increased & Public scandal had mounted. Industrialization now affected massive sectors beyond textile mills.
Two major laws were passed in August 1867:
	Factory Acts Extension Act: Applied to large industrial establishments employing 50+ people. However, it was weakened by compromises, loopholes, and vicious exceptions that appeased capitalist interests.
	Workshops Regulation Act: Applied to all small workshops where children, women, or youth worked. Held parents and employers jointly responsible for illegal child labor. This theoretically extended regulation across nearly the entire spectrum of non-factory labor, but in practice it was toothless.
The Workshops Act’s enforcement was entrusted to local and municipal authorities, who: Had no resources, will, and were often complicit with local employers. When the state finally transferred enforcement to factory inspectors in 1871, 100,000 workshops and 300 brickworks were added to inspectors responsibilities, yet only eight assistants were added.
The bourgeois Parliament was forced to adopt strong measures in principle, because the abuse was undeniable. But it applied them with hesitation and dishonesty, sabotaging their effectiveness. This reflects the deeper structural truth of capitalism: the state will only curb exploitation when pressured, and even then, only begrudgingly.
Mining is treated separately because it reveals an important political-economic relationship: In mining, landowners and capitalists share interests, unlike in factories (where their interests sometimes conflict). This unity of capitalist interests meant almost no legislative action occurred, despite horrific conditions.  
	The 1842 Mining Act only barred women and children under 10 from underground work. The 1860 Mines Inspection Act required school certificates for boys 10–12, but was never enforced due to too few inspectors and employer obstruction. By 1866, the Select Committee on Mines produced only a five-line report, saying more witnesses needed examination (stalling).
The parliamentary committees cross-examined of mining workers reveals the political class directly acts on behalf of capital. Committee members respond with questions transparently attempts to justify exploitation using the rhetoric of concern, claimed that the lack of education is the fault of parents rather than industrial despotism.	
Miners have no faith in coroner’s juries investigating fatal accidents because the process is corrupt and the verdicts rarely match evidence. Every institution (law, inquiry, inquest) serves capital.
## 10. Large-scale Industry And Agriculture 
Machines in agriculture may harm workers bodies less than factory machinery, but they make agricultural labour redundant even more aggressively. Because rural populations are dispersed and less organized, they resist job displacement less effectively. This leads to absolute depopulation of the countryside despite expanding cultivation.
Large-scale agriculture abolishes the traditional independent peasant and replaces him with the rural wage-laborer. This brings the same class antagonism found in cities into the countryside. It also dissolves the old unity between domestic industry and farming, replacing it with a technologically rationalized, science-driven process.
By concentrating people in cities, capitalism intensifies the disconnect between humans and the land. Nutrients consumed in cities are not returned to the soil, degrading long-term fertility. Capitalism simultaneously boosts short-term productivity and undermines the natural conditions for sustained soil health, damaging both urban and rural workers in different ways.
The tools and organization of labour become instruments of domination. Social cooperation, necessary for modern farming, turns into a mechanism of control. The scattered rural workforce has less ability to resist, while urban workers become more collectively powerful through concentration.
Large-scale agriculture produces cheap food and massive output by consuming workers health and depleting natural fertility. Every advance in capitalist agricultural technique is simultaneously an advance in soil robbery.
Capitalism advances technique and social cooperation but at the cost of corroding the two foundations of all wealth: the worker and the soil. In doing so, it creates the historical necessity for a new, socially regulated metabolism between humans and nature.
Large-scale industry revolutionizes agriculture more profoundly than any other sector by replacing peasants with wage-laborers, disintegrating traditional rural life, and subordinating farming to scientific, industrial methods. While it increases productivity, it also creates severe social and ecological crises: workers are weakened, soil fertility is exhausted, and the natural metabolic cycle between humans and the earth is disrupted. Capitalist agriculture thus develops the forces of production while simultaneously destroying the very human and natural foundations on which production depends.
## Summary because all of this is still as long as a short story
1. Machinery evolves historically from simple tools into complex systems that reshape production and subordinate workers. 
2. Machines amplify labor output and become independent of human muscle through motive power like steam or water. 
3. Early machines combined the motor, transmitting mechanism, and working tool. Later, multi-machine systems and automatic factories emerged, where human intervention became minimal, and the machine dictated production. 
4. The development of machinery created technical contradictions, requiring mechanization of machine production itself and the growth of heavy industry. Industrial innovations spread across sectors, transforming entire branches simultaneously.
5. Machines do not generate new value, rather they transfer the value embedded in themselves gradually. 
6. Their adoption depends on profitability, not labor-saving potential, and often cheap human labor delays mechanization. 
7. Machinery increases productivity while reducing necessary labor, allowing capitalists to lengthen working hours and incentivized the exploitation of unskilled labor (women and children), dissolving traditional family structures.
8. Factories centralize labor under strict discipline and surveillance, transferring skill and control from workers to the system of machines. Labor becomes monotonous, deskilled, and subordinated to capital.
9. The struggle between workers and machinery transforms class conflict, as machines embody capital’s domination. Workers are displaced, creating a permanent reserve army that depresses wages and intensifies competition, as it expands production and reduces labor intensity, generating unemployment and precarity.
10. Large-scale industry disrupts handicrafts, domestic work, and agriculture, concentrating labor in factories and cities while mechanizing rural production. 
11. Factory acts and education reforms emerge only under social pressure, partially mitigating exploitation but even then are constrained by capitalist interests.
12. Overall, machinery increases productivity and reshapes labor, but does so in a way that deepens social inequality due to the nature of capital. But this opens the door for creating the technical and social foundations for a future society in which labor could be rationally organized for human development rather than profit.
