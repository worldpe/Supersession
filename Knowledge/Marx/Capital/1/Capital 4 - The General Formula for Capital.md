## How Capital Arises & Functions
Capital is value in motion, a process where money and commodities are mere forms, and the ultimate goal is the automatic self-expansion of value. Unlike simple commodity circulation, capital circulation has no inherent limits, driven by the endless pursuit of surplus-value.

Capital emerges from the circulation of commodities (C->M->C, selling to buy). Historically, capital first appears as money, not land or commodities. All new capital begins as money that is then transformed into capital through circulation.
- C->M->C (Sell To Buy): Starts and ends with a commodity, with the aim of consumption (use-value). Money is merely and intermediary.
- M->C->M (Buy To Sell): Starts and ends with money, with the aim of accumulation of money (exchange value). Money is advanced to generate more money.
**If M->C->M only exchanges equal amounts (M = M), it would be meaningless:** The goal is M′ = M + ΔM (surplus-value).
Reflux of money vs. commodity circulation:
- In C->M->C, money returns only through repeated transactions: circulation ends with consumption.
- In M->C->M, money returns as part of the same process: the circuit is continuous, driven by the goal of increasing value.
The distinctive feature of capital is that it generates surplus-value (M′ > M).
- The process is quantitatively different from simple commodity circulation: it’s not just exchanging commodities of equal value.
- Use-values are irrelevant to the capitalist, the aim is the endless expansion of exchange-value.
The capitalist is the personification of capital, starting and ending the process with money.
- The capitalist actively circulates money to produce more money.
- The capitalist views all commodities as means to increase money, not as ends in themselves.
Money and commodity as forms of value: 
- In C->M->C, money is a temporary, independent form of value.
- In M->C->M, money and commodities are forms through which value actively circulates and expands.
- Value acquires a life of its own, differentiating into original value and surplus-value, but merging at the end (M → M′).
The General formula of capital:  M->C->M′ (money → commodity → more money) expresses the essential movement of capital.
Variations on this formula:
- Merchant capital: full M->C->M′ circuit.
- Industrial capital: same principle, with intermediate production stages.
- Interest-bearing capital: abbreviated to M—M′ (money generates more money directly).
