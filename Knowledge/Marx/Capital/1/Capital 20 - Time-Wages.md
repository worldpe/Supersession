Time-wages (pay by the hour) arise from the value of labour-power, and how this form conceals exploitation. Time-wages make it appear as though the worker is paid for each hour of labour, but in fact the hourly wage is just the daily value of labour-power divided by the length of the working day, meaning each hour contains both paid and unpaid labour. Time-wages obscure the real wage (price of labour-power), create illusions about rising or falling wages, encourage overwork, and enable capitalists to use irregular employment to intensify exploitation.

 Time-wages are the direct, simple form of representing the value of labour-power: The worker sells labour-power for a definite period of time. The simplest way to express them is: daily, weekly, & hourly wage.
 The crucial distinction: total daily wage vs. price of labour. Daily or weekly wages do not equal the price of labour.
	To calculate the price of labour: Price of one hour = (daily value of labour-power) ÷ (average length of working day).
The same daily wage can hide a falling price of labour, if nominal wages stay constant while hours increase, the hourly price of labour falls. Nominal wages can stay the same while real wages (price of labour) collapse.
	Nominal wage: money received
	Real wage: means of subsistence it buys, or the labour actually paid for)
Daily wage can also rise even while the price of labour falls:
	If the worker works more hours, daily wage rises without an increase in hourly wage.
	If labour intensity increases, more work per hour = more daily pay.
	The hourly price of labour remains the same (or even falls).
	 The bottom line is: **Daily wage ↑ does not mean exploitation ↓, often it means exploitation ↑ because unpaid labour expands.**
Time-wages create “under-employment suffering”
Because hourly price is set by dividing daily value of labour-power by 12 hours:
 If paid for fewer than 12 hours, the worker cannot earn the value of his labour-power.
 Example: If he works 6 or 8 hours at 3d/hour, he earns only 1s 6d or 2s — not enough to reproduce himself.
Thus:
 Time-wages punish the worker for being employed less than the “normal” working day.
This leads to chronic insecurity and poverty — not because wages are “low,” but because employment is intermittent.
Hourly wages give capitalists a weapon: irregular employment. When the capitalist pays only for the hours he chooses to hire:
	He can use the worker for 3 hours, then dismiss him for 2, then hire him again for 2. This destroys the relation between paid and unpaid labour. The hourly unit becomes meaningless if the day has no stable length. The capitalist can extract surplus labour without ensuring the worker earns enough for daily subsistence.
	This creates severe underemployment, alternations of extreme overwork and no work, greater insecurity for workers and mischievous acts, which only legal limits on the working day can prevent. (The London builders revolt in 1860).
The illusion of overtime pay is that in industries without legal limits a normal part of the day is treated as the baseline, and ,ours beyond this are overtime and paid slightly more. But the normal hourly wage already includes unpaid labour, so the overtime wage also includes unpaid labour, just a smaller portion of it. Capitalists insist on extra pay for overtime, but only because surplus labour beyond the customary norm becomes obvious to them. Capitalists see overtime, but cannot see unpaid labour during normal hours.
General empirical law: longer hours = lower wages. Historical evidence show that: In industries with the Ten Hours Act, wages rose. In industries with 14–15 hour days, wages fell. Therefore, the longer the working day, the lower the wages tend to be, because time-wages reward lengthening the day, which reduces the hourly price of labour, increases surplus labour, and enables competition between workers (more labour per worker = more supply). This pushes wages downward.
The cycle of how long hours drive down wages is as such:
	Step 1: Longer hours → more labour supplied → labour competition goes up → wages go down.
	Step 2: Lower wages → workers must work longer hours to survive → hours go up.
	Step 3: Capitalists compete using abnormally long unpaid labour → prices fall → wages are forced down to maintain profits.
	These steps result in abnormally low commodity prices, permanently depressed wages, entrenched overwork. 
		The underselling London bakers used workers unpaid labour to undercut prices, forcing all bakers into a race to the bottom.
The capitalist’s ideology is that capitalists do not in fact actually see that normal wages include unpaid labour, or that surplus labour is embedded in the normal working day. They only see that overtime as the place where unpaid labour becomes visible, competition "forcing" them to exploit workers more and their own profit as a sort of 'public benefit'. Their worldview reflects only the appearance of the relation, never its essence.
