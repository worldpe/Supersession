## Productive Labour
"To be a productive worker is therefore not a piece of luck, but a misfortune."

In the abstract labour process, **Productive Labour** simply refers to labour that produces use-values with tools and materials: In early individual labour, mental and physical labour are unified.
However, under capitalism this definition becomes insufficient, because the labour process is now shaped by a specific social relation: capital’s command over labour for the purpose of generating surplus-value. Being a 'productive worker' no longer depends on whether one directly manipulates materials, but whether one's activity contributes to capital’s self-valorization.
This broadens the concept of productive labour (since many roles now serve the collective labourer) but also narrows it (only labour that produces surplus-value counts as productive). A schoolmaster, for example, becomes productive only when employed by a private school owner whose capital he valorizes. 
## Absolute & Relative Surplus-Value
**Absolute surplus-value:** The foundational form of capitalist exploitation, extending the working day beyond the time needed for the worker to reproduce the value of their labour-power. When productivity is fixed, only a longer working day raises the rate of surplus-value.
	**Necessary Labour:** Time needed to earn the wage equivalent.
	**Surplus Labour:** Extra time worked for the capitalist.
**Relative surplus-value:** Transforming production, arises not from lengthening the day, but from shortening the necessary labour-time through higher productivity, better machinery, more intense labour, & reorganized production processes. Since workers produce the value of their wages faster, more of the fixed-length working day becomes surplus labour. When the working day is fixed, only altering productivity or intensity can increase surplus-value.
	This requires a specifically capitalist mode of production, and a real subsumption of labour under capital (where capital reshapes the labour process itself).
The capitalist constantly oscillates between extending the day and revolutionizing production.
## Formal & Real Subsumption of Labour
**Formal Subsumption:** Workers become wage-labourers without changes in how they work.
**Real Subsumption:** Capital transforms the labour process technologically and socially in order to boost relative surplus-value. This turns traditional labour into industrial labour, producing the characteristic features of modern capitalism.
Hybrid forms exist as well (usurer’s capital, merchant’s capital, modern domestic industry) that exploit producers without fully capitalist relations of production.
## Surplus Labour
Surplus labour requires that workers have some time beyond what is needed for survival, but the existence of a surplus product does not automatically imply capitalist surplus-value. Low natural needs and high natural fertility (Egypt, tropical regions) can create free time, but free time only becomes unpaid labour for another class under specific historical conditions.
The natural conditions (fertility of soil, climate, natural resources) determine the baseline of necessary labour and how much surplus labour is possible, but not the form that surplus labour takes.
Capitalism requires not abundant nature but the domination of nature by society.
## Classical Econ
Physiocrats, see only agricultural labour as productive. R
Ricardo assumes surplus-value as given to treat capitalism as natural.
John Stuart Mill confuses labour-time with the durability of products, and makes the absurd claim that workers advancing unpaid labour to capitalists makes workers capitalists.
	Mill also tries to show that profit would exist without exchangeh, undermining the very basis of capitalism.
Bourgeois economists avoid the real question: the origin of surplus-value in unpaid labour.
