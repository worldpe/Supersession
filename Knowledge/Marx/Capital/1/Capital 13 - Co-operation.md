## Co-Operation
Co-operation is the first and most fundamental form of capitalist production. When many workers labor together under a single capitalist, their combined activity generates a social productive power greater than the sum of individual efforts. However, because this co-operation is organized and controlled by capital, its benefits appear as powers of capital rather than of labor. What begins as a social advance in productivity thus becomes, under capitalism, a deeper form of domination.

Capitalist production really begins with co-operation, when a single capitalist employs many workers at once, this marks the shift from individual or small-master production to collective labor under one owner. What begins as a quantitative change (more workers at once) turns into a qualitative transformation: the production process becomes social in nature, even though ownership remains private.
**"The surplus-value produced by a given capital is equal to the surplus-value produced by each worker multiplied by the number of workers simultaneously employed"**
	When many workers labor together, their combined effort averages out individual differences in skill or efficiency. This establishes the collective working day, the unit of average social labor. Production now reflects society’s general standard of labor rather than the quirks of individual workers. This standardization benefits capitalists by stabilizing output and ensuring predictable value creation.
Working together allows many workers to share buildings, tools, and materials. This joint consumption of the means of production makes them cheaper per worker or per product: economy in the use of the means of production. The same tools and facilities now serve more workers, reducing cost and raising efficiency.
Co-operation generates a new productive power: a social productive power that exists only when labor is organized collectively, and the combined effort produces effects no individual could achieve alone.
Workers can now perform different parts of a process simultaneously or in sequence, greatly speeding production. For example, masons passing stones up a ladder together work far faster than one mason alone. Co-operation enables the division and synchronization of work even before the formal division of labor or machinery enters the picture.
Although co-operation develops labor’s social productivity, it only arises under capitalism when a capitalist brings workers together by purchasing their labor-power. This means the conditions for co-operation (organization, facilities, wages, etc) depend on the capitalist’s control of money and means of production. The social power of labor appears as a property of capital.
Once many workers are organized under one capitalist, direction becomes essential. The capitalist (or their managers) acts as the commander of this industrial army, ensuring order, coordination, and discipline. This function of direction arises both from the technical need to coordinate collective work and from the class antagonism between the capitalist and the workers. As co-operation grows, so too does this industrial despotism.
The increased productivity from collective labor costs the capitalist nothing extra, workers are paid their individual wages, but their combined labor produces more than the sum of their parts. This social power of co-operation therefore appears as an inherent property of capital, even though it actually comes from the collective nature of human labor.
In ancient and medieval societies, co-operation was based on common ownership or direct coercion (slavery). Under capitalism, it emerges through free wage-labor, but in practice workers co-operation is still controlled by capital.
Many workers laboring together under one capitalist marks the transition from isolated, independent labor to collective, social labor subordinated to capital. Later developments like manufacture (division of labor) and machinery build on this foundation.
