#Philosophy/Marx/Capital [[Capital]]
Expropriation of English peasants not only created a proletariat for industry but also produced the home market for industrial capital. As peasants lost their land, their means of subsistence and raw materials became commodities handled by capitalist farmers and manufacturers. Rural domestic industry collapsed, workers were forced to buy goods on the market, and industrial capital found both labour-power and a stable internal market. Only with large-scale industry and machinery was this transformation completed.

Expropriation of peasants created an industrial workforce. The expulsion of peasants from the land was used to fuel the growth of industrial labour. As peasants lose their holdings, they become a free mass of proletarians outside the guild system, exactly the labour-power industrial capital needs. This demographic shift mirrors a physical process: concentration in one area requires depletion in another. Fewer peasants meant a denser industrial population.
Agricultural output increases even as peasants disappear, production rises or remains stable because capitalist agriculture introduces: improved farming techniques, cooperation and larger-scale operations, concentrated means of production, and intensified labour. While people are freed, so are their former means of subsistence, now available for industrial capital to appropriate through wages.
Peasants are expropriated their food, raw materials, and tools stop serving as the basis of independent household production. Then you see the transformation of subsistence into capital. These goods reappear as constant capital (raw materials, machines) and variable capital (means of subsistence purchased as wages) in the hands of industrial capitalists.  While the material is unchanged, its social function is entirely transformed.
Before this shift, spinning and weaving were dispersed among thousands of rural households, but under capitalist reorganization: tools and workers are crowded into central factories (labour-barracks), independent work becomes wage-labour, the capitalist appropriates surplus labour directly. Large combined workshops enrich capitalists, while dispersed workshops enriched many small producers.
**The expropriation of peasants creates the home market.** When peasants produced their own means of subsistence, they consume them directly. After expropriation large farmers produce these goods as commodities, sold on the market. Workers must buy them, using wages they earn from industrial capitalists. Goods formerly consumed in the household now circulate commercially. From here, a domestic market for industrial commodities arises.
Rural domestic industry collapses: Spinning/weaving, once done by peasant families for their own needs, becomes industrialized. This destruction of rural domestic production is crucial because it pushes peasants into wage-labour, concentrates demand into a unified national market, and provides stable outlets for industrial goods.
Under the earlier manufacturing stage (pre-machinery): domestic industry is weakened but not destroyed, it reappears in new forms because manufacturers still rely on cottage production for certain tasks, because of this peasants periodically reappear in diminished form. This explains the historical observation about the continual destruction and reappearance of English peasantry.
True large-scale industry finally eliminates rural domestic industry, fully separates agriculture from household craft, forces the majority of rural people into wage-labour, and unifies the national home market under capitalist conditions. Machinery is the decisive force that completes the capitalist transformation of the countryside and industry alike.
