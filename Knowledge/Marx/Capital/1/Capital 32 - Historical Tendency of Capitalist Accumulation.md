#Philosophy/Marx/Capital [[Capital]]
Capitalist accumulation has a historical tendency: it begins by expropriating small independent producers, but once capitalism is established, it proceeds to centralize capital and expropriate the capitalists themselves. Production becomes increasingly social, but ownership remains private, a contradiction that ultimately becomes unsustainable. As the number of capitalists shrinks and the proletariat grows, capitalism generates the conditions for its own overthrow. The final outcome is the transformation of capitalist private property into social, collective property: "the expropriation of the expropriators."

Primitive accumulation is not just violence or plunder; it is the historical destruction of a form of private property. Primitive accumulation dissolves the old unity and replaces it with the worker who owns nothing but labour-power, and the capitalist who owns the means of production, which are now socially used but privately controlled. Pre-capitalist private property was rooted in personal labour, while capitalist private property is rooted in the exploitation of others labour.
Self-owned small-scale property (peasant land, artisan tools) is a basis for the worker’s individuality, skill, and independence. It is historically necessary in early stages of humanity, but inherently prevents large-scale cooperation, planned production, technological application, and social control over nature. This form of property is tied to dispersed production, fragmented holdings, limited productivity, and narrow horizons of social life. It eventually produces its own demise, because once productivity expands and social forces accelerate, this small form cannot sustain the new needs of society.
Capitalism emerges through concentration of means of production, expropriation of independent producers, and transformation of scattered tools/lands into large, social means of production. Capitalist private property is the historical negation of small-scale private property.
After capital has already separated workers from means of production, a second transformation begins, anew expropriation process emerges: capitalists expropriating other capitalists. This is centralization, big capital swallows small capital, competition eliminates many capitalists, and a few giant capitalists monopolize the means of production. This is an immanent, internal process, no longer caused by state force. Production becomes more cooperative, technology becomes more scientific, machinery allows massive joint labour, and the world market unites all nations. Production becomes increasingly social, while appropriation remains private. This contradiction becomes capitalism’s fundamental limit.
Capitalism produces both increasing misery and increasing organization of the working class:
	(1) Growing exploitation and misery: As capital centralizes, the mass of workers grows, exploitation intensifies, and insecurity, degradation, and poverty deepen.
	(2) Growth of proletarian organization: But capitalism also trains workers in cooperation, unites them in large workplaces, concentrates them in cities, and exposes them to shared conditions. This creates a class conscious of itself as a class. The proletariat becomes a social force capable of expropriating the expropriators.
**The contradiction: social production vs. private appropriation**
The central thesis: Production becomes social in character (many workers cooperating within interconnected global industries), but ownership remains private, monopolized by a shrinking capitalist class. Eventually, the capitalist integument becomes too narrow for the vast productive forces it contains. When the contradiction becomes intolerable, capitalism’s shell 'bursts asunder.'
**The "negation of the negation"**
Marx applies a Hegelian formula to show the logical outcome of tendencies already active in capitalism itself.
	First negation: Small private property (based on personal labour) is negated by capitalist private property.
	Second negation: Capitalist private property is negated by social property: collective ownership by the associated producers.
	This second negation does not restore small private property, it produces: Socialized ownership, common control of the means of production, and individual development grounded in social cooperation.
