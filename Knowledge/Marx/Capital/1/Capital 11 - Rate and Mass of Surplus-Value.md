#Philosophy/Marx/Capital [[Capital]]
## Rate and Mass
The mass of surplus-value is determined by the rate of exploitation of labor-power and the number of workers employed. Variable capital (money spent on labor-power) is the key determinant; constant capital (machines, raw materials) only facilitates labor but does not create surplus-value. Compensation between factors (longer work hours vs. fewer workers) is possible but constrained by the natural limits of the working day. Capitalism fundamentally transforms labor relations: capital exerts control over workers through ownership of means of production, turning labor into a source of surplus-value.

The value of labor-power (the necessary labor to reproduce it) is assumed constant. The rate of surplus-value (degree of exploitation) directly determines the mass of surplus-value produced.
**Variable capital and number of workers:**
	**Variable capital:**  total money spent to buy labor-power.
	Mass of surplus-value grows with the number of workers employed:
		Mass of surplus-value = Variable capital * Rate of surplus-value
	Increasing the number of workers or increasing the rate of exploitation raises total surplus-value.
A decrease in variable capital (fewer workers) can be compensated by an increasing the rate of surplus-value (longer working day, more exploitation per worker).
	Conversely, a lower rate of surplus-value can be offset by employing more workers.
	Even maximal exploitation per worker cannot exceed the absolute limit of the working day.
Mass of surplus-value depends on:
	1. Rate of surplus-value (degree of exploitation)
	2. Amount of variable capital (number of workers)
	Constant capital (machines, raw materials) affects production only indirectly; it does not generate surplus-value by itself.
For society as a whole, the social working day is the sum of all individual working hours. Increasing population (more workers) or extending working hours increases total surplus-value. There is a mathematical and physical limit to how much surplus-value can be extracted based on these factors.
Capital converts money and means of production into power over living labor. Means of production, once owned by a capitalist, act as a legal and practical claim on workers labor. The capitalist’s role becomes one of commanding and extracting labor, not directly producing themselves.
Workers initially control the labor process, but under capitalism, labor-power is subordinated to the needs of capital. Machinery and workshops are valued not just for their physical qualities but for their ability to extract surplus labor.
