#Philosophy/Marx/Capital [[Capital]]
Wages appear as the price of labour, even though the worker actually sells labour-power, not labour. Labour cannot be a commodity and has no value. The wage-form disguises the fact that part of the working day is unpaid surplus labour, because wages make all labour appear paid. The wage form obscures the real relation of exploitation and generate the ideology of fair exchange. Classical political economy partly uncovered the truth but failed to articulate it explicitly, while vulgar economics clings to the misleading appearance.

On the surface, it looks like: Worker performs X hours of labour & Capitalist pay Y amount of money for that labour. Labour appears to have a natural price, with wages representing payment for labour itself.
Labour cannot have a value because labour is the substance of value. Value is the socially necessary labour-time, to say labour has a value would require measuring the value of labour by labour itself. This produces a tautology like '12 hours of labour have the value of 12 hours of labour'.
Labour cannot be sold because it must already be alienated to exist, and it can only exist as activity in time, ergo it does not exist before being performed. For something to be a commodity, it must exist before it is sold to be bought. The worker does not sell labour, only the capacity to labour: This is the commodity labour-power.
Direct exchange of living labour for money would destroy capitalism: If the capitalist paid the full value created in a 12-hour day, then the worker would receive the full 12 hours of value, and the capitalist would receive nothing extra. No surplus-value would be created and thus capital would not exist. Capitalism inherently requires paying less than the value created, but paying less than the value created would mean that unequal quantities of labour exchange directly with each other, which violates the law of value. Therefore: labour cannot be the thing sold, the capitalist must buy labour-power, not labour.
**Labour is value's immanent measure,** therefore it cannot itself be a value-bearing commodity; The substance that creates value cannot have a value: You cannot measure the value of the measuring rod by itself.
Classical economists inherit the everyday notion price of labour, and try to treat labour like any other commodity. Eventually they end up analyzing the value of labour-power, not the value of labour. They replace the question 'What is the value of labour?' with 'What is the cost of producing the worker?'. But they never consciously admit that they have shifted categories, this leads to contradictions that vulgar economists exploit.
If daily value of labour-power = 3 shillings = 6 hours of socially necessary labour, then the working day = 12 hours. 
	Worker receives 3 shillings (6 hours paid labour) & produce 6 shillings (12 hours of value): 12 hours of labour = 3 shillings, a nonsensical statement, as 12 hours create 12 hours of value, not 6.
Under capitalism the worker is paid the value of labour-power (6 hours), but the wage appears as the price of the entire 12-hour day. Wages erase the distinction between paid and unpaid labour, making unpaid labour (surplus labour) appears as paid. In slave labour, all labour appears unpaid. In Corvée, paid and unpaid labour are visibly separated in time. But in wage-labour, all labour appears paid, even the unpaid portion. Wages therefore conceal exploitation at the level of social appearance.
All bourgeois moral notions (fairness, freedom, equal exchange) rely on the wage-form because the transaction looks like any other commodity sale: money for an object. Labour supplied looks like a commodity supplied. Payment occurs after the labour, so it appears to pay for that labour. Labour-power and labour’s product appear identical. Workers themselves experience wages as 'I give 12 hours; I get paid more or less for those 12 hours',. Every change in wages looks to them like a change in the value of their labour, even though the value of labour does not exist.
Two everyday observations mislead people, but neither phenomenon proves that labour is sold.
	 Longer hours = more pay: People think this means the price of labour is proportional to time worked, but renting a machine longer also costs more. This doesn’t mean the machine’s operation is being sold.
	Different workers doing the same job get different wages: This also occurs under slavery (different market prices for slaves). The worker’s labour-power varies, not labour itself. 
The essence is the value of labour-power, but the appearance is wages, which look like value of labour. Forms of appearance arise spontaneously in everyday practice, science must penetrate beyond them. Classical economists almost found the truth but did not fully theorize it; vulgar economists stop at appearances and worship them.
