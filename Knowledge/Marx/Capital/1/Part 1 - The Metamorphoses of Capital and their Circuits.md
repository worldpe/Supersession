#Philosophy/Marx/Capital [[Capital]]
### Capital in Its Three Forms:
**Money Capital (M):** Money capital is money that the capitalist advances in order to start the production process. They use it to buy labour-power (workers) and means of production (tools, materials, machines). It counts as capital only because it is money being used with the purpose of coming back as more money (M′).
**Productive Capital (P):** Productive capital is the combination of workers and means of production actually working together in production. This is the only stage where new value is created, because labour produces more value than its own cost.
**Commodity Capital (C′):** Commodity capital is the finished product coming out of production, now containing surplus-value. It is written C′ because it is not just a commodity, it is a commodity with extra value inside it. This commodity must be sold for the surplus-value to be realized and eventually return as M′.
### The Circuits of Capital
**Circuit of Money Capital (M–C … P … C′–M′):** The capitalist’s perspective: starting with money, ending with more money. Money → commodities → production → commodity with surplus → money with surplus.
**Circuit of Productive Capital (P … C′–M′–C … P):** Begins and ends with productive capital. Emphasizes the renewal of the production process itself.
**Circuit of Commodity Capital (C′–M′–C … P … C′):** Begins and ends with commodity capital. Focuses on the commodity as bearer of surplus-value.
**Three Circuits Taken Together:** All three circuits operate simultaneously across different capitals. The unity of these overlapping circuits constitutes the movement of total social capital.
### Elements Purchased by Capital
**Labour-Power (L or LP):** The worker’s capacity to work, which the capitalist buys. As a commodity, its value equals the socially necessary labor to reproduce the worker’s life.
**Means of Production (MP):** All non-labor inputs into production: machinery, tools, raw materials, etc. Represent the “constant” component of capital.
**Means of Consumption:** Wage goods consumed by workers and luxury or consumption goods purchased by capitalists.
Value Components of Capital
**Constant Capital (c):** The value of the means of production. It does not add new value; it merely transfers its existing value to the product.
**Variable Capital (v):** The value laid out on labor-power. It does create new value. Called 'variable' because it can expand, the source of surplus-value.
**Surplus-Value (s):** The value produced by workers beyond what is required to reproduce labor-power. Appropriated by the capitalist.
**Prime Notation (′):** Indicates capital has expanded (e.g., M′ = M + ΔM).
### Reproduction Schemes
**Simple Reproduction:** Capitalists consume all surplus-value. Production continues at the same scale.
**Expanded Reproduction:** A portion of surplus-value is reinvested. Production grows over time.
**Reserve Fund:** Money capital held back as a precaution, enabling smooth reproduction or coping with disturbances.
### Circulation Concepts
**Circulation:** The non-production phases of capital’s movement: buying and selling.
**Circulation Time:** The time during which capital is tied up in the acts of purchase or sale. A necessary but unproductive interval.
**Production Time:** The period during which productive capital actually produces new value. Includes both working time and unproductive pauses inherent in production.
**Turnover:** The full transformation of capital through all three forms (M → C → P → C′ → M′). A measure of how quickly capital can expand.
### Costs of Circulation
**Pure Circulation Costs:** Expenses that arise solely because products take a commodity form (bookkeeping, sales time, monetary transactions). These do not add value.
**Costs of Storage:** Costs associated with holding inventory. Some storage is part of social production and can add value (preserving or maturing goods), but much of it is a circulation cost.
**Transport Costs:** Unique: they can create value when they materially change the commodity’s use-value by spatial relocation.
### Distinct Roles and Categories
**Merchant Capital:** Capital functioning in the sphere of circulation (buying/selling). Does not create surplus-value but appropriates a portion of the total.
**Money-Capitalist:** A capitalist who lends money. Makes profit through interest, a deduction from surplus-value.
**Functioning Capitalist / Industrial Capitalist:** The capitalist who uses money to run production, hire labor, purchase means of production, and realize surplus-value.
### Commodity vs. Money
**Use-Value:** The specific utility or usefulness of a thing, what inputs can materially reproduce production.
**Exchange-Value:** The quantitative value expressed in money, how capital moves and whether reproduction can occur on value terms.
**Realization:** The conversion of the value embedded in C′ into actual money (M′). Necessary to complete the capital cycle.
### The Unity of Production and Circulation
**Metamorphosis of Capital:** The transformation of capital from one form to another. Capital must constantly change form; failure in any metamorphosis breaks the circuit.
**Desynchronization of Cycles:** Each form (M, P, C′) exists simultaneously in different stages across different capitals. This non-synchronous motion enables continuous reproduction.
