## 1. A Growing Demand for Labour-Power Accompanies Accumulation if the Composition of Capital Remains the Same
If the composition of capital remains constant, capital accumulation necessarily increases the demand for labour-power and can temporarily raise wages. However, this rising demand simply expands the scale of capitalist exploitation: workers remain dependent, surplus-value remains the purpose of production, and higher wages only loosens the "golden chain" of wage-labour. The movement of wages is entirely determined by the movement of capital. Whenever rising wages threaten the supply of surplus labour, accumulation slows, wages fall, and equilibrium is restored. The supposed law of population is not natural but an expression of the shifting relation between paid and unpaid labour required by capital.
- - -
The compositional structure of capital is presented in two forms:
	(1) Value Composition: How capital splits into constant capital (c) & variable capital (v)
	(2) Technical Composition: The physical ratio of means of production & living labour
	(3) Organic Composition: A synthesis of the value composition of capital insofar as it reflects the technical composition.
	Different individual capitals have different compositions. The average composition across all sectors is the composition of the total social capital. This social composition ultimately determines labour demand.
If composition stays constant, accumulation requires more workers. Under the simplifying assumption that a given mass of machinery requires a fixed mass of labour. So when capital grows, variable capital must grow proportionally, more wages must be paid & more workers must be employed. Capital accumulation is the rising demand for labour-power, so long as the technical relation c:v does not change. This also means that the "labour fund" actually grows. Workers may see rising wages & improved material living standards under capitalism in this way.
Rising wages do not dissolve the capital–labour relation, even when wages rise because of increasing demand for workers, workers remain dependent on selling labour-power. More capital simply requires more proletarians. The accumulation of capital corresponds to the accumulation of the proletariat. Even high wages merely loosen, but never remove, the "golden chain" of wage-dependence: the worker is still compelled to return to work every day, surplus labour is still extracted. The capitalist still buys labour-power only to valorize capital, not to meet personal needs. Rising wages is not diminishing exploitation, a worker’s improved consumption freedom
Economists like Smith and Ricardo equated accumulation with the consumption of surplus product by workers. They believed capital grows because surplus is reinvested into hiring more labourers and correctly saw that accumulation enlarges the working class. This was correct, but they failed to understand the inner mechanism: Accumulation depends on unpaid labour, which is then used to purchase additional paid labour. The wealth of the rich exists only because of the labour of the poor, society needs a large population of dependent workers, and workers must remain ignorant and poor to stay labouring. The system depends on maintaining a mass of labourers who must sell themselves daily.
Rising wages can occur temporarily, but only within limits set by capital’s need for surplus labour. A key law: The rate of accumulation determines the rate of wages; not the other way around. The two possible outcomes when wages rise are:
	(1) Rising wages do not block accumulation: Capital continues to expand, unpaid labour decreases relative to total labour, but total labour increases with accumulation, exploitation continues, only in altered form. 
	(2) Rising wages slow accumulation: Then capital accumulation slackens, as the profit margins shrink and the incentive to expand declines. But once accumulation slows, labour becomes excessive, wages fall again, the rate of surplus labour restores itself, and accumulation resumes. Wages rise only until they interfere with surplus-value creation.
Capital immediately corrects this by slowing accumulation and pushing wages down. Classical economists misinterpreted these movements as too many workers or too few workers. The movement of wages is caused by shifts in accumulation (the independent variable).
Malthus says the capitalist law of population: The relative demand for labour is determined by the needs of capital accumulation for additional paid labour to set in motion newly accumulated unpaid labour. The working population is not naturally too large or too small. It is too large only relative to capital’s needs at a given moment. When accumulation accelerates, labour-power is too small. When accumulation slows, labour-power is too large. The fundamental relation: The relation between capital and wages is simply the relation between paid and unpaid labour of the same working class.
## 2. A Relative Diminution of the Variable Part of Capital
As capitalism accumulates, it raises the productivity of labour and therefore revolutionizes its technical basis. Means of production grow enormously relative to living labour, causing the organic composition of capital to rise. Although variable capital may rise in absolute terms as capital expands, it falls relative to constant capital. At the same time, both concentration (growth of individual capitals) and centralization (fusion of capitals through competition and credit) accelerate the transition to massive, highly mechanized production. These processes increase scale, reorganize labour, spur technical change, and ultimately decrease the relative demand for labour-power, even as capital grows. This sets the stage for the formation of a proletarian surplus population and the contradictions of accumulation.
- - -
Accumulation inevitably transforms the technical composition of capital; The productivity of labour rises. This has two consequences: 
	(1) Workers process a greater mass of raw materials per hour (ex: through division of labour, machinery, and scientific technique). 
	(2) Production requires an increasingly massive body of machinery, infrastructure, and tools. 
These two factors working in tandem become preconditions of heightened productivity: 
	The ratio of means of production to labour-power rises.
	Labour becomes relatively smaller compared to its objective conditions.
	This is the technical composition of capital shifting toward a higher proportion of machinery and materials.
Rising productivity increases constant capital relative to variable capital, and appears in capital-value terms as: 
	(1) constant capital (c) grows faster
	(2) variable capital (v) shrinks relatively
	The organic composition of capital rises, c:v becomes increasingly weighted toward c.
	The value increase understates the real material increase of machinery, because machinery becomes cheaper per unit as productivity increases.
Variable capital can rise absolutely while falling relatively; v can shrink relative to the whole while still expanding in absolute size.
	Example: Absolute value grows from $6,000 to $18,000; Relative value changes from $3,000 (50%) to $3,600 (20%). In this scenario, Relative value went down 30%.
	Critically capital must triple just to increase labour demand by 20%, and in that way labour becomes less and less demanded in proportion to the growth of total capital.
Large-scale production, machinery, and the application of science require: co-operation of many workers, massive tools/infrastructure, division of labour, & collective organization. 
	These presuppose concentrated capital, capitalist development requires that means of production be gathered in large quantities in the hands of private capitalists. This is why capitalism historically begins with primitive accumulation, but then constantly reinforces concentration through ongoing accumulation.
Accumulation → large-scale production → rising productivity → more surplus-value → more capital → further accumulation.
	Rising productivity increases the organic composition of capital, which in turn changes labour demand, this is how accumulation and capitalist production mutually accelerate each other in a self-reinforcing spiral.
There are two ways this process of accumulation can happen:
	Concentration (via accumulation of money): The gradual growth of individual capitals, limited by total social wealth, slow process.
	Centralization: Redistribution of already existing capital, happens through bankruptcies, competition, the credit system, mergers & joint-stock companies. It is not limited by the existing level of wealth and can be extremely rapid.  It is especially potent because it allows enormous industrial undertakings (railways, telegraphs) that could not have arisen by slow accumulation alone. It accelerates the technical transformation of production, the rise of the organic composition of capital, and reduces the relative labour demand.
Centralized capitals operate on larger scales, reorganize production more systematically, adopt labour-saving machinery more intensively, and renew capital faster with new technical compositions. 
	Therefore: Old capitals, when renewed, shed workers. New capitals, though larger, attract fewer workers proportionally. Capitalist progress leads to less labour needed per unit of capital, periodic expulsion of workers, and a long-term decline in relative labour demand. This is one of Marx’s foundations for the general law of capitalist accumulation and the reserve army of labour (developed shortly afterward).
## 3. The Progressive Production of a Relative Surplus Population or Industrial Reserve Army
Capitalist accumulation inevitably produces a relative surplus population, the **industrial reserve army of labour**. This occurs because rising productivity reduces the amount of labour needed relative to total capital. Even as capital expands, workers are displaced faster than new jobs are created. This surplus population is essential to capitalism: it allows for rapid industrial expansion, keeps wages low, intensifies competition among workers, and stabilizes capital’s profits across the cycle of boom and crisis. The existence and reproduction of this reserve army is not an accident but a structural law of capitalist production and the basis for the cyclical instability of modern industry.
- - -
Accumulation leads to rising constant capital & falling variable capital relative to it. Even when variable capital grows in absolute terms, it becomes a smaller fraction of total capital as productivity rises. 
	**Demand for labour grows more slowly than capital;** Rising organic composition → falling relative demand for labour.
	Formally, as c:v it is 1:1 → 2:1 → 3:1 → 5:1 → 7:1 → etc, the relative share of investment in living labour shrinks.
	This process accelerates as both accumulation and centralization occur, causes labour demand to lag behind capital growth, and produces workers who are no longer needed at the same rate as the expansion of capital
	Accumulation produces a surplus population relative to its own needs
Capitalist accumulation necessarily produces a population of workers that exceeds capital’s average requirements for valorization. This occurs even when total population grows slowly, even when employment grows absolutely, and even when industries expand. What matters is not the number of workers, but the **ratio** between available workers and the amount of labour capital actually needs. As productivity rises, fewer workers are needed per unit of capital. Capitalism itself generates unemployment, independent of demographic factors.
This surplus population appears as an 'industrial reserve army of labor', the surplus population becomes a permanent feature that is always available for exploitation when capital expands, quickly drawn in when markets boom, and in turn, quickly expelled when crisis strikes. This reserve army allows capital to expand production rapidly in booms, depress wages in stagnation, maintain flexibility in the labour market, and forces competition among workers. It is a lever guaranteeing capital’s ability to respond to market opportunities.
The industrial cycle (10-year boom->crisis->stagnation cycle) is linked to fluctuations in the reserve army:
	Boom → reserve army absorbed, wages rise modestly
	Crisis → massive layoffs, reserve army grows
	Stagnation → cheap labour available, wages suppressed
	Recovery → reserve army partly reabsorbed
	Boom again → repeat
	This cycle did not exist in early capitalism, could not exist without a reserve army, and becomes more violent as accumulation speeds up. Capitalism reproduces the conditions of its own instability.
Capital’s expansion is not smooth but occurs in sudden leaps, with new markets, new technologies, new production, new infrastructure, all expanding rapidly at different paces. With such sudden expansions capital requires a population of workers who can be thrown into production immediately, in case the need arises. If labour supply depended only on natural population growth, capital would be constrained, and it must maintain a surplus labouring population.
Capitalism can cheapen labour not only by firing workers (**mechanization**) but also by intensifying labour (longer hours, higher speed, multiple tasks), substituting skilled workers with unskilled ones, replacing adults with women or children, turning more labour-power inferior or low-wage. This means that the relative surplus population grows even faster than mechanization itself, and the two sides reinforce each other:
	Overwork of employed workers → more unemployment
	Unemployment pressures the employed → accept more overwork
	This dynamic structural exploitation makes the reserve army expand as accumulation advances.
Malthus is wrong: It is not that population grows faster than subsistence, capital needs an excess population to regulate wages. Wages fluctuate according to the ratio between the active army and the reserve army, not the total number of people. Wages rise only when the reserve army is small, wages fall whenever the reserve army expands, real wage increases never threaten capitalist profit because they trigger mechanisms (like mechanization) that restore the surplus population. Farmers introduction of machinery in response to tiny rural wage increases is given as historical proof.
You would assume that demand for labour depends on capital, and supply of labour depends on workers numbers. But in reality capital controls the supply of labour by creating unemployment, and controls the demand for labour by limiting how much labour it hires. Capital manipulates both demand and supply of labour simultaneously: Capital increases labour supply by displacing workers, increases labour supply by intensifying the labour of the employed, decreases labour demand through mechanization, and "sets free" whole segments of the population. The law of supply and demand in labour is not natural, rather it is engineered.
## 4. Different Forms of the Relative Surplus Population / The General Law of Capitalist Accumulation
Capitalism can expand only by constantly generating a surplus population, and therefore requires the perpetual insecurity and degradation of the working class. The different forms of the industrial reserve army are floating, latent, stagnant, and pauperism. Capitalism necessarily produces and reproduces these forms. This reserve army is essential for capitalist expansion as it supplies cheap labour when needed and depresses wages when not. The general law of capitalist accumulation is "as capital grows, the relative condition of the working class must worsen." Greater wealth produces greater unemployment, insecurity, and misery among workers. Accumulation of wealth at one pole produces accumulation of suffering at the other.
- - -
**The Floating Surplus Population:** In Modern industry, workers are constantly being hired and fired depending on market fluctuations and technological change.  Employment expands, but at a decreasing rate relative to the growth of capital. Youth are hired, but adults are discarded, capital prefers fresh labour-power. Many workers are worn out prematurely and are thrown back into unemployment by age 30–40. They are replaced quickly by a new generation because of: early marriages, high birth rates among the poor, and bodily wear-and-tear. This group is always in motion, attracted and repelled like a tide.
**The Latent Surplus Population:** Capitalist farming is highly productive and uses very little labour, so in agriculture, rural labour demand falls absolutely over time. A constant overflow of agricultural workers moves to towns, but even before they migrate, the countryside contains a latent surplus population waiting to be drawn into industry. As a result, rural wages sink toward bare minimum subsistence. The rural labourer always has one foot in pauperism.
**The Stagnant Surplus Population:** In irregular, low-wage, high-exploitation sectors, many workers live below average working-class conditions. They act as a constantly available cheap labour reservoir for capital. Self-reproducing: high birthrates + high mortality → rapid turnover. Their misery is structurally necessary to capitalist exploitation.
**Pauperism:** The lowest segment of society, this includes able-bodied workers temporarily out of work (massive during crises), orphans & pauper children (future cheap labour supply), disabled/sick/injured workers who capitalism has broken, widows, the old, those unable to adapt to the division of labour, and the lumpen-proletariat (criminalized, vagabonds, prostitutes). It functions as the hospital of the active labour army, or the dead weight of the industrial reserve army. Capitalism continuously produces it, and offloads the cost onto the poor themselves.
Capital accumulation generates an ever-growing surplus population, as machinery and productivity rise faster than labour demand. The relative need for workers falls, the surplus population expands and more wealth creates a larger reserve army. The larger reserve army leads to more precariousness for employed workers, which causes a greater downward pressure on wages. The greater the social wealth, the greater the industrial reserve army.
Accumulation of wealth at one pole causes the accumulation of misery at the other. Workers experience more intense labour, longer hours, lower security, more accidents and premature death, and family breakdown & child labour. Even when wages rise, the relative position of labour worsens as workers become appendages of machines. Capital despotically controls work-life, productivity grows faster than pay, and life expectancy decreases in industrial districts. Be wages high or low, conditions worsen with accumulation.
The key function of the reserve army is to keeps wages in check. Capital does not need labourers to control population, capital itself adjusts the labour supply by hiring in booms, firing in crises, mechanization, intensifying labour, displacing rural workers, and ruining small producers. The reserve army therefore in a way continuously disciplines the active army, and the cost of this arrangement is shifted onto the working class.
Productivity rises, but instead of freeing workers, it only induces greater pressure on workers livelihoods. The working population always grows faster than capital’s need for valorization, not biologically but structurally. The capitalist form of the law of population is the inverse of the natural one.
Other economists perceived this antagonism, but mystified it and could not make a structural critique.
## 5. Illustrations of the General Law of Capitalist Accumulation 
### (a) England from 1846 to 1866: Accumulation and Concentration
Population increases steadily but the rate of increase declines each decade, while wealth grows explosively; The creation of wealth accelerates faster than population.
Capital concentration and centralization intensify, small farms submerge into large one, huge estates appear more frequently in taxation, high-income groups grow richer; Incomes rise sharply for property owners, while they shrink in numbers.
The workers see no comparable improvement, even bourgeois statesmen can’t hide that relative poverty has worsened alongside enormous wealth accumulation.
Between 1863–1865: prices rises in meat, butter, milk, sugar, salt, coal, so even if money wages increase modestly, real wages stagnate or decline.
Official pauper numbers jump by hundreds of thousands in the 1855–1865 decade, and crises in 1857 & 1866 drove this further. Pauper numbers fluctuate with the industrial cycle, but actual pauperism is higher than official figures, because workers avoid the brutal workhouse until the last moment. 
### (b) The Worst-Nourished Industrial Strata
Dr. Edward Smith calculates bare nutritional minimums required to prevent 'starvation diseases', and finds cotton workers are living at or below these minimums, causing an official inquiry into workers nutrition to be launched. The investigation into urban and rural labourers discovers that most indoor operatives fall below minimum nitrogen and carbon intake. Agricultural labourers in the wealthiest parts of England are often worse fed than urban labourers. Women and children suffer most because the man must eat to do his work. Needlewomen, silk-weavers, kid-glovers and shoemakers live at or below the level of famine-relief diets. These are not unemployed vagrants, but the most industrious layers of the working class.
### (c) The Nomadic, Migratory Labourers
Nomabic labourers: The mobile armies of workers used in: railway construction, brick-making, drainage, lime-burning, & major building projects. They drift from site to site, housed in shoddy, overcrowded wooden huts that  lack drainage, ventilation, or sanitation. Workers pay rent to the contractor, making them exploited twice (as labourers and tenants). 
These camps spread smallpox, cholera, typhus, and scarlet fever across the country. A report from Sevenoaks in 1864 documents: no quarantine hut despite repeated promises, repeated epidemics, numerous deaths, families concealing disease to avoid eviction. This shows capital’s indifference to even minimal health measures when profit is at stake.
### (d) Crises and the Best-Paid Workers
Even the labour aristocracy is vulnerable:
	(1) The 1866 crisis: The failure of a major London bank triggers mass unemployment. Iron shipbuilding crashes especially hard.
	(2) Skilled workers reduced to stone-breaking for threepence. Workers and families starving, respectable families sleeping on bare floors, well-paid men reduced in months to beggary. Even families who had saved a sizable sum descend into starvation after months of unemployment.
Crises demonstrate that even high wages cannot protect workers within capitalism. The privileged worker is only temporarily privileged.
English liberals point to Belgium as a free-trade utopia, but a family of six workers earns 1,068 francs/year at best. To eat like a soldier, sailor, or prisoner, the family would need 1,400–1,800 francs. Workers survive only by: reducing food, reducing clothing, sharing beds, crowding into one or two rooms, pawn shops, giving up leisure, and/or keeping children half-fed. As a result 200,000 out of 450,000 Belgian working-class families are paupers. Free-trade capitalism merely universalizes poverty.
### (e) The British Agricultural Proletariat
Even English agriculture becomes more productive, scientific, and profitable, the agricultural labourer becomes poorer and more disposable. Wages fall below subsistence, cottages are demolished, overcrowding spreads, and workers are pushed into pauperism. Capitalist farming reduces workers to a zero cost in production, feeding them worse than convicts. 
Mechanization creates both a chronic surplus of rural labour and periodic shortages, leading to extreme exploitation of women and children through the gang-system. 
Capitalist agricultural progress develops the soil while destroying the worker: wealth accumulates at one pole, misery at the other.
### (f) Ireland
Ireland’s population collapses from 8.2 million (1841) to ~5.5 million (1866) due to famine and mass emigration.
Smallholdings disappear en masse; larger holdings increase, land shifts from tillage to pasture.Less food is produced, but more surplus-product is created for export to Britain.
Despite reduced population and reduced agricultural output, rents rise: Pasture farming requires fewer workers and creates a higher share of surplus product. Cattle and wool prices rise in England, enriching landlords and large farmers. Ireland becomes effectively an agricultural appendage of England, specializing in exporting raw food and labour. Means of production previously used by peasants for subsistence become capital in the hands of landlords.
Economists claim population causes poverty; Ireland proves the opposite: Population drops drastically, misery does not decrease, relative surplus population persists. Unlike wars or plagues, Irish emigration removes people without destroying productive forces. Emigrants in America send money home, funding more emigration. Ireland 'exports' its poor and becomes a sheep-walk for English capitalism.
