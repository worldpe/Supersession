#Philosophy/Marx/Capital [[Capital]]
Variations in the working day, labour intensity, and productivity alter the value of labour-power and the amount of surplus-value extracted. These factors interact in complex ways, but in every case, the distribution of the working day between necessary and surplus labour is the pivot. Productivity changes alter surplus-value through wage-value; intensity increases can raise both wages and surplus-value simultaneously; changes in working hours shift surplus labour directly. In combined cases, capital can maintain or even increase exploitation despite adverse conditions (ex: falling productivity). Capitalist’s drive for surplus-value is structurally flexible and can adapt through multiple levers, while the worker’s share is always constrained.

The value of labour-power depends on the value of workers customary means of subsistence (treated as constant in physical quantity), the cost of developing labour-power, and family composition and labour-power diversity (ignored here for analytical clarity). Only the value, not the physical quantity, of means of subsistence changes with productivity.
Assuming commodities sell at their value & wages may rise above but never fall below the value of labour-power, the relation between wages and surplus-value depends on:
	Length of the working day
	Intensity of labour (labour expended per hour)
	Productivity of labour (labour required per commodity)
	Different combinations of these produce different distributions of necessary labour and surplus labour.
## Case 1: Constant Working Day & Intensity; Productivity Variable
**Initial:** Working Day = 12 hours, 12 hours = value of 6, If Necessary Labour-Time = 6 hours → S = 6 hours, Surplus-value = 3 shillings, wages = 3 shillings
|------ 6h N (3s) ------|------ 6h S (3s) ------|
**Productivity Increases:** N = 4 hours, S = 8 hours, Total value still = 6 shillings, Wages now = value of 4h = 2 shillings, Surplus-value = 4 shillings
|---- 4h N (2s) ----|---------- 8h S (4s) ----------|
N shrinks, S expands, Total W stays the same: Surplus-value grows
**Productivity ↑ → N shrinks, S expands
Productivity ↓ → N expands, S shrinks**
- Law 1: A fixed working day always creates a constant amount of value, regardless of productivity, a 12-hour day creates the same new value (e.g., 6 shillings). Higher productivity spreads this 6 shillings over more commodities.
- Law 2: Value of labour-power and surplus-value vary inversely 
	if productivity increases: necessary labour-time falls, value of labour-power falls, surplus labour rises → surplus-value rises. 
	If productivity decreases: necessary labour rises, wages (value of labour-power) rise, surplus-value falls.
- Law 3: A change in surplus-value presupposes a change in wage-value caused by productivity changes in surplus-value are effects, not causes. 
	The causal chain is: Productivity change → value of labour-power changes → surplus-value changes.
When productivity rises, those goods become cheaper, so the same wage can now buy more. This means both workers and capitalists can end up with more use-values even if there is no change in the wage rate or the amount of surplus-value being extracted. The change is proportional: The smaller the original surplus-value, the larger the proportional increase when productivity rises. Workers may consume more use-values even as their relative position worsens. If productivity doubles but the wage stays nominally the same (or falls slightly), workers get more cheap goods, but: their share of the working day shrinks relative to capital’s share. **Inequality widens despite better material consumption: Relative Immiseration**.
Ricardo assumes the only variable is productivity, fails to distinguish surplus-value from profit, and confuses changes in the rate of surplus-value with changes in the rate of profit.
## Case 2: Constant Working Day & Productivity; Intensity Variable
Initial: |------ 6h N (3s) ------|------ 6h S (3s) ------|
Intensified: |------ 6h N (4s) ------|------ 6h S (4s) ------|
Intensity means the rate at which labour is expended. A more intense workday: produces more value, without changing the value per commodity (unlike productivity increases). A 12-hour day may now create 7 or 8 shillings instead of 6. Both wages and surplus-value can rise simultaneously. 
But if wages don’t rise enough to compensate for faster wear-and-tear: wages fall below the value of labour-power, exploitation intensifies in real terms. Intensity becomes national, different countries have different normal intensities of labour, therefore different working days embody different amounts of value.
## Case 3: Working Day Changes
Initial: |------ 6h N ------|------ 6h S ------|
Shortened: |------ 6h N ------|-- 4h S --|
Surplus shrinks → SV falls.
If the working day is shortened, then necessary labour stays the same, surplus labour shrinks absolutely and relatively, and surplus-value shrinks unless wages fall below value. Capitalists argue against shorter hours on this basis, but historically, shorter days coincide with rises in productivity or intensity, altering the outcome.
Initial: |------ 6h N ------|---------- 8h S ----------|
Lengthened: |------ 6h N ------|---------------- 10h S ----------------|
Surplus grows drastically.
If the working day is lengthened then necessary labour remains constant (in this abstract model), surplus labour expands, wages may rise in nominal terms but fall relative to value. 	Past a certain point deterioration of labour-power accelerates, wages cannot compensate for the damage, the working day becomes physically destructive and self-undermining. Surplus-value and wages may both rise when the day is lengthened, or intensity rises.
## Case 4: All Three Factors Vary Simultaneously
All three can combine to produce complex redistributions, but always around the pivot of necessary labour (N) vs. surplus labour (S).
Case A: Falling productivity + longer working day: If productivity falls then necessary labour rises, surplus labour shrinks unless the day is lengthened. Lengthening the day can preserve or increase absolute surplus-value, shrink its relative share, or increase both absolute and relative amounts (if long enough). Historical example (England 1799–1815): Despite rising food prices (falling productivity), surplus-value rose due to intensification of labour and extreme prolongation of the working day. This produced rapid capital accumulation, rapid pauperization.
Case B: Rising productivity + rising intensity + shorter working day: Productivity and intensity reduce necessary labour, enabling shorter working hours. Reductions in the working day never reduce surplus labour to zero; Only removing capitalism (abolishing surplus labour as exploitation) could allow a workday equal only to necessary labour.
The more productivity rises, the more free time society can produce. But under capitalism, free time is created for one class by turning the lifetime of the masses into labour-time.
