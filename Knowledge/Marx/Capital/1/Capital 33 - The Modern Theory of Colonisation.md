#Philosophy/Marx/Capital [[Capital]]
colonization exposes the true foundation of capitalism more clearly than Europe does. In colonies, because workers can obtain land and work for themselves, wage labour is scarce and capitalist production cannot secure the dependence it needs. Political economists such as Wakefield openly admit that capitalism requires the expropriation of workers from their means of labour. To create capitalist relations in colonies, land must be artificially restricted so workers are forced into wage labour. The chapter’s central insight is that capitalist property can only exist by destroying the independent property of small producers.

Political economy confuses two kinds of private property into one category of "private property", in order to obfuscate the fact that the earlier form was destroyed.
	(1) Pre-capitalist private property based on the producer’s own labour.
	(2) Capitalist private property based on the exploitation of others labour.
In Europe, primitive accumulation is already completed, the mass of independent producers has already been expropriated, political economists can pretend that capitalist property is natural, wage labour is voluntary, and capital is simply stored-up labour, but this ideological confusion works only because the actual violent history has vanished into the past.
In colonies, workers generally own their own means of production (land, tools). This means that they can work for themselves, do not need to sell their labour-power, and therefore cannot be compelled into wage labour. Colonies reveal the actual, hidden pre-condition of capitalist production: the worker must be separated from the means of labour.
Political economy in Europe must conceal capitalism’s violent origins, but in colonies, where capitalism has trouble establishing wage-labour, political economists like Edward Gibbon Wakefield openly admit: capitalist production requires expropriated workers, cooperation and large-scale production require dependence, and free access to land must be blocked. 
Wakefield correctly observes that Capital is not wealth as such, and capital only exists as a social relation, which presupposes a class of wage-labourers. In that way, arich man in a colony is not a capitalist unless workers depend on him for a living. "Mr. Peel imported money, tools, goods and 3,000 workers to Australia. Upon arrival, all workers left to become independent farmers. Peel was left 'without a servant to make his bed', because he had forgotten to export the English class system."
Because land is plentiful and cheap workers quickly become independent producers, wages stay high, workers do not remain dependent long enough to generate capitalist accumulation, and capitalist agriculture cannot be established. Worse still, every time a worker becomes a farmer, a new anti-capitalist competitor appears. This destroys the regular supply of labour, the possibility of creating a surplus population, the dependence of workers on capitalists. In colonies, capitalism’s normal conditions of reproduction collapse.
To artificially recreate European conditions, Wakefield proposes the government must set a high sufficient price on land to prevent workers from becoming independent too soon. Workers must first labour long enough to generate capital for others. The money raised from selling expensive land should be used to import more wage-labourers, keeping the labour market full. This policy is called **systematic colonization**. It deliberately manufactures dependence so capitalist relations can take root.
