## 1. The Degree of Exploitation of Labour-Power
Once you isolate variable capital from constant capital, you can deduce the quantity of exploitation. The rate of surplus-value (s/v), the ratio of surplus to necessary labor, measures the degree of exploitation, since all surplus-value arises from workers producing more value than the cost of their own labor power.

**Surplus-value as valorization of capital:** When production ends, the commodity’s value exceeds the value of the capital advanced. The surplus (s) represents the new value created by labor beyond what is needed to reproduce wages (v).
**Constant vs. variable capital in value creation:**
	Constant capital (c) Only transfers its existing value to the new product (it doesn’t create new value).
	Variable capital (v) Spent on labor power, creates new value (v + s).
	Thus, the value created in production is not (c + v + s), but only v + s.
**Surplus-value arises solely from variable capital:** Surplus-value results from the worker producing more value than the value of their wages. Only living labor adds new value; constant capital is 'dead labor' that doesn’t grow.
**Rate of surplus-value (s/v):** Marx defines the rate of surplus-value as the ratio of surplus-value to variable capital: s/v.
	This expresses the degree of exploitation of labor power.
	Example: If s = 90 and v = 90, then s/v = 100%, meaning half the working day is spent reproducing wages (necessary labor) and half producing surplus (surplus labor).
**Necessary vs. Surplus labor:**
	Necessary labor-time: The part of the workday where the worker produces the value of their own subsistence (their wage).
	Surplus labor-time: The extra hours worked beyond this, which produce surplus-value for the capitalist.
	The ratio of surplus to necessary labor (surplus labor/necessary labor) is equivalent to s/v.
The rate of surplus-value is not the rate of profit: The capitalist’s rate of profit (s/(c + v)) looks smaller because it includes constant capital, but the true measure of exploitation is s/v, the ratio of unpaid to paid labor.
## 2. The Representation Of The Value Of The Product By Corresponding Proportional Parts Of The Product
Every part of a finished product physically represents a portion of the total value created in production. Most of that value comes from past labor already embodied in the means of production (constant capital), which simply reappears in the new product. A smaller portion comes from the living labor of workers, which adds new value divided between the replacement of wages (variable capital) and surplus value for the capitalist (profit). The same proportions that appear in the product’s composition can also be understood in time: part of the working day replaces the materials and tools used up, part reproduces the worker’s wages, and part creates surplus for the capitalist. Both the physical product and the duration of labor reflect the underlying structure of capital (c + v + s).

**The 12-hour spinning workday:**
	The spinner works 12 hours, producing 20 lb of yarn valued at 30 shillings (s).
	Breakdown of value:
		Constant capital (c) = 24s (from cotton + worn machinery = 20s + 4s) | Variable capital (v) = 3s (the value of labor power, i.e. wages) | Surplus-value (s) = 3s (created by surplus labor) | Total = 30s (20 lb yarn)
		Formula: 30s = 24s (c) + 3s (v) + 3s (s)
**Each component of value is embodied in a proportional part of the product:**
	Since 20 lb of yarn = 30s: 16 lb (8/10 of total) represent the constant capital (24s). |  4 lb (2/10 of total) represent the new value (6s) = v + s.
	The 16 lb correspond to all previously expended labor (in cotton and tools).
		They contain no new labor, only transferred value from means of production.
		Marx likens this to cotton that spins itself, the illusion that the material reproduces its own value.
	The 4 lb represent only newly created value (6s) from living labor: 2 lb = variable capital (3s) → replaces wages. | 2 lb = surplus-value (3s) → unpaid labor producing profit.
	Thus: 16 lb → constant capital (dead labor) | 	2 lb → necessary labor (v) | 2 lb → surplus labor (s)
**The total labor embodied in the yarn:**
	Total = 60 hours of labor embodied in 20 lb. | 48 hours = past labor in means of production (constant capital) | 	12 hours = living labor in spinning (variable + surplus)
	Confirms the value composition of the final product (c + v + s).
**The value composition of the product mirrors the value composition of capital:** Each proportional part of the physical product corresponds to one of the three value components:
	Constant capital (c): previously spent labor, reappearing.
	Variable capital (v): necessary labor, replacing wages.
	Surplus-value (s): surplus labor, source of profit.
**Temporal vs. spatial representation**
	In 8 hours, the spinner reproduces the value of cotton (constant capital). | In 1h 36m, he replaces the value of worn machinery. | 	In 1h 12m, he produces the value of his wages (necessary labor). | In the final 1h 12m, he produces surplus-value for the capitalist.
	Thus, the working day can be divided in time just as the product is divided in space.
Worker literally do not literally produc cotton, spindles, and machinery during the first part of the day, the past labor embodied in means of production comes from other workers, over multiple prior working days.
The product’s physical form mirrors its value composition, revealing how past labor (constant capital) and living labor (variable + surplus) coexist in every commodity; Only living labor creates new value.
## 3. Senior’s "Last Hour"
Nassau Senior’s claim that all capitalist profit comes from the final hour of the working day, as he assumes that most of the day is spent reproducing the costs of production, and only the last hour creates profit. But the worker constantly adds value throughout the entire day, not just in one last hour. Profit arises because part of the worker’s daily labor is unpaid, not because of any special final hour. The last hour theory is a false justification for long working days and capitalist exploitation.
## 4. The Surplus Product
The surplus product is the portion of the total product that embodies surplus value (the unpaid labor of workers). Its size is not measured by the total output but by how much it exceeds what is needed to replace the workers wages (necessary labor). Since the goal of capitalism is to produce surplus value, the wealth of a capitalist is measured not by total production, but by the proportion of surplus product relative to the necessary product (How much unpaid labor has been extracted).
