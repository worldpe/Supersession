## The Labour Process
The labour process is humanity’s purposeful transformation of nature through work, using tools and materials to produce useful things (use-values), regardless of the social or economic system in which it occurs.

**Labour as a Universal Human Activity:** Labour is the process by which humans interact with and transform nature to produce use-values (things that satisfy needs). It is a purposeful, conscious activity that distinguishes humans from animals: the worker imagines and plans the product before creating it.
The **Basic Elements of Labour** consist of three parts:
1. Purposeful activity (the work itself)
2. Object of labour (the material being worked on)
3. Instruments of labour (the tools or means used to shape the material).
**Means of Production and Historical Development:** The instruments of labour (tools, machines, land, etc.) reflect the level of development of human society and its social relations. For example, primitive tools vs. industrial machinery show different epochs.
**Transformation of Nature and Self:** By working on nature, humans also change themselves (developing skills, knowledge, and control over natural forces).
**Products as Results and Conditions of Labour:** Labour consumes materials and tools (means of production) to produce new use-values. These products can themselves become new means of production, this is a cycle of continuous transformation.
**Productive vs. Individual Consumption:** Labour consumes means of production productively (to make new goods), unlike personal consumption, which destroys use-values for sustenance or enjoyment.
**Labour Under Capitalism:** When labour-power is sold to a capitalist, the labour process still produces use-values, but the capitalist controls the process, and the product belongs to the capitalist, not the worker. The worker’s labour-power is used up just like any other commodity purchased by the capitalist.
## The Valorization Process
Surplus-value is the source of profit and it arises because workers produce more value during their labor time than the value of their wages, transforming money into self-expanding capital.
- - -
**Commodities and Capitalist Production:** The capitalist produces goods not because society needs them, but to create value, specifically surplus value, beyond what was spent on raw materials, tools, and wages.
**Value Creation:** The value of a commodity equals the total labor (past and present) embodied in it. The cotton, spindle, and spinner’s labor all transfer their value into the yarn.
**No Surplus in Simple Exchange:** If the capitalist pays the full value for materials and labor-power, and the worker only replaces that value through labor, no profit (surplus-value) results, value merely shifts forms.
**The Secret of Surplus-Value:** The key lies in the difference between the value of labor-power and the labor it can perform. The worker’s wages equal the value of what’s needed to live (say, 6 hours of labor), but the worker can work longer (say, 12 hours). The extra 6 hours create surplus-value for the capitalist.
**Valorization vs. Value Creation:** When labor only replaces the value of labor-power, it’s just value creation; when it goes beyond that and creates surplus, it becomes **Valorization:** The transformation of money into capital.
**Conditions for Value Production:** Labor must be socially necessary and use efficient tools and materials; waste or inefficiency doesn’t create value.
**Capitalist Production Defined:** The unity of the labor process (creating useful things) and the valorization process (creating surplus value) defines the capitalist mode of production.
