#Philosophy/Marx/Capital [[Capital]]
**Absolute Surplus-Value:** Surplus-value generated by extending the length of the working day beyond the time necessary for workers to reproduce the value of their labour-power. It comes from more hours, not from better machinery or productivity.
**Necessary Labour-Time:** The portion of the working day in which the worker produces value equal to their wage; The value needed to reproduce their labour-power (food, shelter, etc.).
**Surplus Labour-Time:** The portion of the working day beyond necessary labour-time, in which the worker produces surplus-value for the capitalist.
**Working Day:** The total daily labour-time. Its length is not fixed by nature but is determined by class struggle between capitalist attempts to extend it and workers’ attempts to limit it.
**Labour-Power:** The worker’s capacity to labour, sold as a commodity. In this part, labour-power is central because it must be purchased for a fixed wage even though it can be worked for longer hours.
**Surplus-Value:** The value created by the worker above the value of their labour-power, appropriated by the capitalist. In this section, surplus-value arises specifically through longer work time.
**Value of Labour-Power:** The socially necessary labour-time needed to produce the means of subsistence required to maintain a worker. This sets the baseline for necessary labour-time.
**Labour Process:** The purposeful transformation of materials by labour. It produces use-values, regardless of capitalism. Marx outlines it before showing how it becomes a process for extracting surplus-value.
**Valorization Process:** The process whereby labour adds value to capital, producing surplus-value. It is the specifically capitalist form of the labour process.
**Simple labour:** Average labour-power requiring no special training.
**Complex labour:** Skilled or more intensified labour, treated as simple labour multiplied.
**Formal Subsumption of Labour Under Capital:** The phase of capitalism where workers are brought under capitalist control without changing the labour process. Surplus is increased simply by extending hours, not by reorganizing production.
**Real Subsumption of Labour Under Capital (introduced as contrast):** Transformation of the labour process itself through machinery, cooperation, and division of labour.
**Piece-Wages:** A wage system where workers are paid by output rather than by time. In the context of absolute surplus-value, it is a mechanism for stretching the working day and intensifying labour.
**Time-Wages:** Payment by the hour/day. This form makes visible the conflict over the length of the working day and is used to illustrate how capital manipulates “normal working days.”
**Legal Limitation of the Working Day:** The struggle for laws to limit working hours (e.g., Factory Acts). Marx stresses that this is a political result of class struggle, not a natural limit.
**Overwork / Overtime:** Work performed beyond customary hours. In this section it exemplifies the capitalist drive for unlimited surplus labour and the physical limits of workers’ bodies.
**Night Work:** Labour performed overnight as a way to extend the working day beyond its previous natural or legal limits.
**The Collective Labourer:** When many workers cooperate in a single process, their labour-power forms a combined social labourer. Introduced here to show how capital coordinates collective exploitation.
**Surplus Product:** The physical form of surplus-value — the extra goods produced during surplus labour-time.
**Capitalist Time-Discipline:** The methods (bells, supervisors, fines, factory rules) used to impose strict control over workers’ time to ensure a long and uninterrupted working day.
**Physiological Limits of Labour-Power:** The natural limits of the human body: fatigue, illness, lifespan. Marx uses these to show capitalism’s tendency to push the working day beyond what is physically sustainable.
**Moral-Historical Component of Wages:** The part of wages tied not to bare subsistence but to socially accepted living standards. Important because capitalists try to push wages toward biological minimums to lengthen surplus-time.
**Rate of Surplus-Value (Rate of Exploitation):** Ratio of surplus labour-time to necessary labour-time. In absolute surplus-value, it rises by enlarging the surplus portion of the day.
**Labour’s Natural Needs:** Referenced critically, capital treats workers as though their needs can be compressed arbitrarily to keep necessary labour-time low.
**The Struggle for the Working Day:** Marx’s historical analysis of how workers fought to limit the working day, showing that the length of the day is not economic but politically contested.
