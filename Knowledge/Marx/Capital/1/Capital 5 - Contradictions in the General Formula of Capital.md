## Why Circulation Alone Cannot Create Value
Surplus-value cannot be created simply through circulation of commodities, surplus-value arises only through production, where labor creates more value than it receives. The M->C->M′ formula points to the movement of capital but does not itself explain the origin of value expansion.

The capitalist’s circulation of money (M->C->M) is formally different from C->M->C, but other participants (sellers/buyers) see no difference, to them the transactions are just normal buying and selling. The connection between the purchase and sale exists only for the capitalist.
In exchanges of equivalent commodities, value is merely transformed, not increased.
- Ex: If A sells wine for £50 and buys corn of the same value, the total value remains the same.
- Any apparent gains from selling above value or buying below value cancel out when both sides are also producers.
- Money as a medium of exchange does not create new value; it only expresses pre-existing value.
Economist confuse use-value with exchange-value:
- Just because a commodity is more useful to the buyer does not mean new value is created.
- Commerce does not add value to products merely because they are transferred to consumers.
Even if a seller overcharges, they will lose equivalent value when buying later. Net surplus-value cannot arise in a system where all participants are both buyers and sellers. This highlights the impossibility of generating surplus-value through circulation alone.
**Merchants capital (M->C->M′):** Profits come from parasitic intermediation, not from producing new value.
**Money-lenders’ capital (M->M′):** Gains are purely from money, not commodities, and are incompatible with commodity-based value. 
	These forms are historically prior but derivative relative to industrial capital.
The necessity of production for surplus-value:
- Surplus-value cannot be created outside circulation, because commodity owners only relate to their own commodities.
- Surplus-value cannot be created purely within circulation, because exchange of equivalents preserves total value.
- Therefore, the origin of surplus-value (and capital) must occur both within circulation and outside it: Production.
The capitalist must:
- Buy commodities at their value.
- Sell commodities at their value. 
- Yet somehow withdraw more value than was advanced.
	This highlights the central contradiction of the general formula of capital: the creation of surplus-value is not explained by circulation alone. It requires the productive exploitation of labor.
