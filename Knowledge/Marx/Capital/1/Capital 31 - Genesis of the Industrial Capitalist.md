#Philosophy/Marx/Capital [[Capital]]
The violent global origins of the industrial capitalist class. Usurer’s and merchant’s capital existed before capitalism but could not become industrial capital until feudal constraints were broken. Once opened, the capitalist class emerges rapidly through colonial plunder, the slave trade, the destruction of indigenous societies, commercial wars, the rise of national debts and banks, heavy taxation, and protectionist policies. These state-backed acts of force supply the wealth, labour, and markets necessary for industrial capitalism. Capitalism’s birth is inseparable from systemic violence.

Before industrial capital, two old forms of capital already existed: Usurer’s capital (lending at interest), and Merchant’s capital (trade and long-distance commerce). These did not yet create capitalist production, but they accumulated money outside the feudal economy. What prevented them from becoming industrial capital was feudal control of the countryside, and guild control of towns. When these fetters collapse (through expropriation of peasants and decay of guilds), merchant and usurer capital can finally transform into industrial capital.
Key historical events flooded Europe with the money that becomes industrial capital:
	(1) Gold and silver plunder from the Americas
	(2) Enslavement, forced labour, and genocide of Indigenous populations
	(3) Plunder of India through the East India Company
	(4) Turning Africa into a human-hunting ground for the slave trade
	(5) These acts are not excesses, they are the structural preconditions for capitalist wealth.
Commercial wars escalate this worldwide plunder, from the Dutch revolt to British anti-Jacobin wars to the Opium Wars, Europe wages global commercial warfare, all to secure markets, colonies, and tribute..
While Spain and Portugal plunder the Americas, Holland perfects colonial trade, and France implements protectionism, England synthesizes all elements: By the end of the 17th century, these gears mesh into a full system that rapidly accelerates the shift from feudal to capitalist production. 
Colonies provide markets and opportunities for speculation and corruption. Colonies supply slave labour, and raw materials. colonies provide. And these things generate gigantic profit streams. The horrors in Java, Bengal, Mexico, the Caribbean, and New England illustrate that the civilizing mission is merely organized theft.
The rise of the public debt is revolutionary: Money lent to the state becomes tradable bonds. These bonds function like capital while remaining risk-free. The system creates a class of rentiers, speculators, and bankocrats. The founding of the Bank of England (1694) represents the consolidation of this system and the rise of a new financial aristocracy. Public debt → taxes → expropriation of small producers. Taxes on basic goods crush peasants and artisans and accelerate their ruin. This further centralizes wealth.
European states use tariffs, subsidies, and bans to forcibly create a domestic capitalist industry. This too is a violent dismantling of older economic forms in the service of capital accumulation.
As large-scale industry rises, capitalists require masses of cheap, controllable labour. This leads to: mass kidnapping of children from workhouses, night labour, brutal overseers, forced labour in remote mill districts, and extreme mortality and suicide. Capital’s early growth depends not on free labour but on child slavery.
The cotton industry spearhead of the Industrial Revolution, yet rests on slave labour in the New World. "The veiled slavery of wage-labourers in Europe needed the unqualified slavery of the New World as its pedestal." Capital in Lancashire is inseparable from slavery in the Caribbean and the American South.
