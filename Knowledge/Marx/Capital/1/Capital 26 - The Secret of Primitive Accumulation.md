**Primitive Accumulation:** The violent historical process that creates the conditions for capitalism by separating producers from their means of subsistence and transforming them into wage-labourers.

Capital accumulation requires surplus value, but Surplus value requires capitalist production. Capitalist production requires capital and wage-labour already in place. Political economy solves this circularity with a myth of "previous accumulation", a one-time origin story in which some people prospered through virtue and thrift, while others became poor through laziness.
Primitive accumulation happened through violent historical process, not a moral fable, these created the conditions for capitalism. Primitive accumulation is the pre-history of capitalism, and its methods are anything but peaceful.
The birth of capital requires the separation of producers from means of production. Money and commodities are not capital by nature. They become capital only when a class of owners of money and means of production confronts a class of free workers, who own only their labour-power and no means to work independently. This requires workers no longer being serfs, workers no longer being guild members, and workers having lost all independent access to land, tools, and subsistence. Primitive accumulation is the historical process that violently divorces workers from the means of labour, creating the proletariat on one side and capitalists on the other.
Workers must be: Legally free, yet economically unfree. Bourgeois historians fixate on the first aspect (emancipation), ignoring the second (expropriation).
Capitalists emerge as a new ruling class by breaking the political power of feudal lords, the regulatory power of guilds and their restrictive labour systems, and using historical upheavals (wars, state actions, religious transformations) to seize property, land, and political control. They achieve this not by heroic entrepreneurship, but through opportunism and often criminal methods.
Before workers became free labourers, they were serfs, bondmen, and enslaved people. Capitalist progress does not eliminate exploitation, it changes its form. The servile form becomes a wage-labour form. The underlying relation, appropriation of the worker’s product by the ruling class, remains.
The crucial lever of primitive accumulation is the forcible removal of entire populations from the land. This produces:
	(1) Land as capital (available for capitalist agriculture)
	(2) People as proletarians (forced onto labour markets)
	Only when peasants are uprooted en masse and deprived of subsistence do wage-labour and capitalism become possible. In England, enclosure, eviction, and legal terror create a proletariat on a vast scale.
