## The Exchange of Commodities
Exchange makes people seem equal and free, but it really expresses their dependence on the market. Money emerges historically as the universal expression of value: the social crystallization of labor. The fetish of money hides the fact that it’s just a social relation between people, appearing as a property of things.

Commodities can't trade on their own, people must enter into social relations with each other to exchange them. Exchange presupposes that both parties recognize each other as private property owners who trade voluntarily (through contracts).
The act of exchange looks like a legal contract between free individuals, but this legal relationship merely reflects a deeper economic reality, the relation between owners of commodities in a system of private production and exchange.
In exchange, people appear merely as representatives of commodities, and commodities seem to act as if they have wills. This hides the fact that human labor is what actually connects them. Social relations between people appear instead as relations between things (this is the root of commodity fetishism).
Each person trades what they don’t personally need (a non–use-value for them) for what they do need (a use-value for someone else). But to make this possible, commodities must first be recognized as values (products of labor that can be compared), before being realized as useful goods. A person brings a commodity to market precisely because it’s not useful to them, its only value to them is that it can be exchanged. Commodities have use-value for others and exchange-value for their owners. Exchange happens so each person can obtain something that is useful to them.
To exchange successfully, commodities must first be recognized as values (expressions of labor). They also must prove their usefulness. Labor only counts if it produces something useful to others. Exchange is the test that confirms whether labor and its products are socially valid.
For each individual, exchange seems a private act to satisfy personal needs, but in actuality it’s a social act that depends on the recognition of value by others. This contradiction (private vs. social) is inherent in the market itself.
Each commodity owner thinks their own good is the universal equivalent (the standard of value). But since everyone thinks that way, no single commodity actually serves that function. Therefore, through social practice, society collectively sets apart one commodity (gold, silver) to serve as the universal equivalent: Money.
Money isn’t invented by decree; it arises naturally from the process of exchange. As trade expands, society needs a stable form to represent value, and one commodity is socially selected for that role. Money becomes the independent form of value that all other commodities express themselves in.
People come to believe gold is money by nature, when in fact society made it so. This inversion, where human social relations appear as natural qualities of things, is what Marx calls the fetishism of commodities, now in its most glaring form: in money.
Exchange is both individual (to satisfy personal needs) and social (to realize value). This contradiction cannot be resolved by personal intention alone, it requires a social mechanism (money) to mediate universal equivalence between commodities.
If every commodity tries to act as the universal equivalent, none can fulfill that role. A universal equivalent must be socially recognized as such through the process of exchange itself; this is how one particular commodity becomes money.
Exchange begins between communities, not within them. Primitive communities are bound by shared production and use, not alienable property. Exchange (and thus commodities) arises only where independent producers meet: at social boundaries.
Money arises spontaneously out of exchange itself: It crystallizes from the social process as one commodity (historically, precious metals) becomes the universal equivalent through repeated acts of trade.
Money is a commodity like any other, and its value is determined by the labor required to produce it (ex: gold mining). It functions symbolically, but its social power is real and material, grounded in labor-time.
Money’s 'magic' arises from social relations between people, not natural properties of gold or silver. People’s labor relations appear as relations between things: this is commodity fetishism, where social power seems to belong to objects.
The 'money fetish' is just the commodity fetish made visible. The social relations of production are obscured behind material appearances, exchange makes people’s relations seem like relations between things.
