#Philosophy/Marx/Capital [[Capital]]
## Constant & Variable
Different parts of capital contribute differently to value creation: Only labor creates new value, while means of production merely transfer pre-existing value to the product, dividing capital into constant capital (means of production, unchanging value, tools, materials & machinery) and variable capital (labor-power, value that grows through labor’s surplus creation). The capitalist profits because workers produce more value than they are paid for, while everything else in production simply reappears in a different form without expanding in value, as only labor adds new value, everything else transforms old values.

**Constant vs. Variable capital:** 
	Constant capital = the part of capital spent on means of production (machines, raw materials, etc.). Its value does not change during production—it is merely transferred to the product.
	Variable capital = the part spent on labor-power (workers’ wages). This part does change in value, because labor not only reproduces its own value (the wage) but also creates surplus-value for the capitalist.
**Transfer of value:** Means of production only transfer as much value as they themselves lose through use (ex: a machine contributes part of its value each day as it wears out).
**Two roles of labor in production:** 
	Labor both adds new value to a commodity (by spending labor-time), and It transfers old value from the means of production (tools, materials) into the new product.
	When a spinner turns cotton into yarn, their labor both adds fresh value (through work time) and preserves existing value (the cotton and spindle’s value gets transferred into the yarn).
**Labour’s Dual Character:** 
	As concrete labor (specific useful work like spinning or weaving), it transfers existing value in this way.
	As abstract labor (human effort measured in time), it creates new value in this way.
**Means of Production: Dead Labor:** The means of production (tools, machines, and raw materials used in production) do not create new value. They only pass on their own value to the new product as they are used up. Means of production transfer value only as they lose their own use-value.
	If a machine costs £1,000 and lasts 1,000 days, each day it adds £1 of its value to the product.
	When raw materials (cotton, coal, etc.) are fully consumed, their entire value reappears in the finished product.
	If something (like air or water) is free, it adds no value, even though it helps produce something useful.
**Constant capital can change in price externally:** If the value of raw materials or machinery changes (due to crop failure, inventions, etc.), this affects the value of products, but these changes originate outside the production process itself. 
Technological progress can increase constant capital and reduce variable capital (more machines, fewer workers), but the qualitative distinction between them remains.
