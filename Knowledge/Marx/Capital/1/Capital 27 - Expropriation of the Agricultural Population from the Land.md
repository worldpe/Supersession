#Philosophy/Marx/Capital [[Capital]]
English peasants were violently dispossessed from the land over three centuries This created a mass of landless, rightless proletarians and transformed the soil into capitalist private property. It is the concrete historical process carried out through force, law, and state power by which the conditions of capitalist production were created.

Before capitalism: England was a country of free peasant proprietors. By the 14th–15th centuries Serfdom had effectively disappeared. Most English people were free peasants owning or controlling small plots. Even agricultural wage-labourers had cottages, several acres, and rights to the commons. Common lands provided grazing, fuel, timber, and supplementary income. This structure supported a large number of self-sufficient peasants, a prosperous urban system, but not capitalist wealth, as producers still owned their means of life.
The shift to capitalism begins when feudal retainers (private armies of nobles) are dissolved and  thousands become free but destitute proletarians. A new commercial and acquisitive nobility replaces the old warlike aristocracy. Rising wool prices from Flemish textile production make sheep more profitable than crops. Massive expulsions of peasants to convert land into large scale sheep pastures.
From Henry VII onward, parliament attempted laws to forbid destruction of farmhouses, force landlords to keep land under cultivation, limit the number of sheep an owner could raise, maintain the peasant’s 4-acre cottage plot. These efforts failed because capitalist agriculture required the very opposite: a landless proletariat and concentrated landholdings. The state tried to halt the process, but developing capitalist interests steamrolled these laws.
The dissolution of monasteries and church estates in the 16th century destroyed the largest charitable and stabilizing institutional landowner, expelled monks, tenants, and dependents onto the labour market, enabled speculators to buy huge estates cheaply, broke the last feudal protections on tenants. Elizabethan England was so overrun with impoverished ex-peasants that Elizabeth introduced the Poor Law (1601), the first legal recognition of mass pauperism. This is the moment when pauperism becomes a permanent feature of English society.
By the 17th century yeomen (middle peasants) still existed, but by 1750 they had essentially vanished, and by the late 18th century the last communal lands had disappeared. The backbone of English rural independence collapsed, without access to land, peasants become wage-labourers.
In the 18th century, the process becomes more systematic as capital gained control of parliament. Enclosure Acts were passed that privatize commons. These acts legally grant the landlords the land they previously stole illegally. The poor are not compensated, except in symbolic or trivial ways. Huge farms emerge, concentrated in the hands of wealthy graziers. Small farmers disappear, working families lose subsistence rights, rural depopulation accelerates, a new class of landless agricultural proletarians is formed.
Without commons, peasants lose resources and thus workers fall below subsistence, wages drop beneath survival levels and are supplemented by Poor Law relief, rural people flood cities, swelling the industrial proletariat. Economists who defend enclosure openly state that: It is good to create landless workers because now they will be compelled to labour more.
In the 18th–19th centuries, especially in Scotland, landlords forcibly expelled entire clans and villages by burning cottages, using soldiers to evict families, transforming inhabited land into sheep-walks, or later deer preserves. later even fishing villages were destroyed once aristocrats discovered profits in leasing land to fish merchants. This is the peak of the violent separation of people from land.
Land becomes capital, peasants become proletarians.
