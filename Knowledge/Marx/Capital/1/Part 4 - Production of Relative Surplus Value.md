#Philosophy/Marx/Capital [[Capital]]
**Relative Surplus-Value:** Surplus-value generated by reducing necessary labour-time (through increased productivity, cooperation, machinery, division of labour), thereby increasing surplus labour-time within the same working day.
**Co-operation (Cooperative Labour):** The simplest form of capitalist production where many workers perform similar or connected tasks in a coordinated way under one capitalist. This increases productivity, creates a collective labourer and gives the capitalist social control over labour-time and movements.
**The Collective Labourer (Combined Labourer:** The unity formed by many individual workers working together in the same process. The productive power of the collective exceeds that of isolated individuals, and this extra productivity yields relative surplus-value.
**Division of Labour (Manufacture):** The systematic breakdown of production into specialized, repetitive tasks, each performed by different workers. This results in deskilling of workers, dependence on capital, increase in productivity, and a foundation for machinery.
**Manufacture (Formal System of Workshop Production):** The historical stage before large-scale industry where many workers collaborate, tasks are divided, tools remain primarily hand-tools, and the labour process is reorganized without machines. It produces relative surplus-value by intensifying productivity via human organization alone.
**Detail Labourer / Detail Worker:** A worker who performs only one partial operation in a divided labour process. Characteristic of manufacture.
**Handicraft:** Individual artisans using hand tools, controlling the whole labour process.
**Manufacture:** Collective work with a partialisation of tasks, producing greater productivity and dependence on capital.
**Deskilling:** The process by which workers lose broad skills and become specialized in one narrow, repetitive task. This results in cheaper, replaceable workers, easier capitalist control, increased productivity, and foundation for machinery.
**Machine / Machinery System:** A tool driven by a motive power (steam, water, etc.) rather than direct human effort. This replaces skilled labour, intensifies production, cheapens commodities (reducing necessary labour-time), and disciplines and subordinates workers.
**Large-Scale Industry:** The form of capitalist production based on machinery, constant revolutionizing of methods, and high productivity. It generates relative surplus-value by: displacing labour, reorganizing whole social processes, and enabling continuous production.
**Motive Power:** The external mechanical force that drives machines (steam, water, electricity). It is central because it detaches labour’s physical limits from production speed.
**Tool vs. Machine:** The tool is extension of the worker’s hand; worker controls its movement, while the machine is an extension of the capitalist’s control; the tool is now driven by an independent mechanical force, subordinating the worker to the machine.
**The Factory System:** A production regime combining machinery, strict time discipline, supervision and control, collective work, continuous labour. Factories represent the full realization of relative surplus-value.
**Productivity of Labour:** Output produced in a given time. Rising productivity reduces the value of wage-goods, thereby reducing necessary labour-time and increasing surplus-value.
**Intensity of Labour:** Degree of exertion within the same working time. Machinery increases intensity as well as productivity, creating more relative surplus-value.
**Cheapening of Wage-Goods:** Because workers wages buy commodities, lowering the value of those commodities reduces necessary labour-time. This is the economic basis of relative surplus-value.
**Real Subsumption of Labour Under Capital:** A deeper stage of capitalist domination where the labour process itself is revolutionized—via machinery, division of labour, and science. Here capital no longer just commands labour, but transforms it.
**Formal Subsumption (contrast):** Workers are employed by capital, but the labour process remains unchanged. Real subsumption creates relative surplus-value by altering the process itself.
**Technology as General Social Knowledge (General Intellect):** The way science and collective knowledge become direct forces of production in large-scale industry.
**Surplus Population / Industrial Reserve Army:** Machinery displaces workers, creating unemployment. Unemployment depresses wages, ensures a supply of labour, and is necessary for relative surplus-value.
**Machine vs. Worker Contest:** Workers’ struggle against machines that replace their labour. This is a structural conflict: machines are introduced to produce relative surplus-value, not merely to help workers.
**Factory Acts (Legislative Limits):** Laws regulating child labour, hours, and safety. Capital adapts to these constraints by increasing productivity to maintain relative surplus-value.
**Technical Composition of Capital:** Physical ratio of means of production to labour-power. This rises with machinery and division of labour.
**Value Composition of Capital:** The same ratio expressed in values: constant capital vs. variable capital. Relative surplus-value presupposes rising constant capital relative to variable.
**Rate of Relative Surplus-Value:** The increase in surplus-value due to reductions in necessary labour-time, not extensions of the working day.
**The Workshop as a Combined Mechanism:** Metaphor for the coordination of many detail workers into a productive totality, anticipating the machine as the real mechanism.
