## The Process of Accumulation of Capital
Capital moves through a cycle: 
	Money → buy labour-power + means of production
	Production → commodities embodying surplus-value
	Commodities → sold for money
	Money → reconverted into capital
	Cycle repeats indefinitely, this loop is the circulation of capital.
Accumulation requires successful sale and reconversion. Capitalists can accumulate only if: Their commodities sell at value, and the money realized is primarily reinvested as capital. The capitalist keeps all surplus-value (even though in reality it will later split into profit, interest, rent, etc.)
Surplus-value is appropriated by the capitalist but not ultimately kept by him alone. Although the capitalist first takes all surplus-value created by unpaid labour, it later gets divided into various forms (profit, interest, rent, merchant’s gain). But this division is irrelevant for understanding accumulation in its pure form, so we treat the productive capitalist as the representative of the whole appropriating class
To understand accumulation, ignore all the obfuscating effects of circulation. focus on accumulation as an aspect of production itself, then later explore its mediated appearances.
	Circulation (money → commodities → money) obscures the simple reality that accumulation is based on extracting unpaid labour. To expose the inner mechanism,

## Simple Reproduction
Even if capitalism never grows at all, and simply reproduces itself at the same scale year after year, the process itself necessarily: reproduces the capital-relation (capitalist vs worker), reproduces the separation of workers from the means of production, turns all capital into accumulated unpaid labour, continually recreates the working class as a class dependent on wages, and renders workers an appendage of capital both inside and outside production.

All production is reproduction: Every society must reproduce its means of production and its workforce. Production always simultaneously is reproduction. Capitalist production necessarily reproduces capitalist relations. No society can produce unless it replaces the tools and raw materials consumed. A portion of each year's product must go back into production.
If production is capitalist, reproduction is capitalist. Capitalist production has one central aim: valorization (making value self-expand). Thus reproduction means: Money must repeatedly function as capital. Surplus-value appears as the capitalist’s revenue. If the capitalist consumes all surplus-value without reinvesting any, reproduction is simple reproduction. 
Wages are a portion of the worker’s own product returning to him. The worker produces both variable capital (the fund out of which his wages are paid) & Surplus-value. 
	Wages appear as payment from the capitalist, but they are in fact the worker’s own past labour, returned in money-form. The capitalist class gives workers money as drafts on the workers own product. The workers immediately give this money back by buying necessities. This demystifies the wage relation, as the worker is paid with his own work.
Variable capital is only the capitalist form of the labour-fund. In all societies, workers must produce the goods required for their own subsistence. Under capitalism, this fund appears as wages (variable capital advanced by the capitalist), but it is still the worker’s own product.
Simple reproduction transforms all capital into accumulated unpaid labour.
	If Capital = £1000, Annual surplus-value = £200, and Surplus-value is all consumed, then after 5 years, the capitalist has consumed £1000 of surplus-value. The capital he now owns is entirely composed of past surplus-value. Not his original property at all. 
	All capital, even if originally acquired by personal labor, becomes, through reproduction alone, objectified unpaid labor of workers. Capital becomes accumulated alien labour.
Production continuously reproduces the worker as a wage-labourer. This is the chapter’s philosophical center, the worker owns no means of production, can live only by selling labour-power, and produces all the conditions of production as capital separate from himself. His own product constantly becomes the means used to employ and exploit him.
	The worker continually produces the capitalist, the capitalist continually produces the worker as a wage-labourer, and capitalist production reproduces the capital-relation itself.
The worker’s individual consumption is a moment of capital’s reproduction. Workers consume to live, but this consumption reproduces their labour-power, reproducing capital. Even consumption outside the workplace is part of producing labour-power; Workers remain a conscious instrument of production. The worker enjoys being compensated, but capital sees it only as maintenance of a productive force.
The working class is an appendage of capital, even outside work because the reproduction of the working class is a condition of capital’s reproduction. Capital continually restricts workers freedom (historical bans on emigration) and workers independence is an illusion created by shifting employers and the wage contract. Capital requires a working class, keeps it available, and shapes its reproduction.
The capitalist class treats workers as living machinery: Workers are trained power, more valuable than machines and are owned implicitly as economic assets.
Capitalist reproduction produces not only commodities and surplus-value, but the capitalist and the wage-labourer as enduring classes. Reproduction is the recreation of capitalist domination.
