## Commodities
A product of labour made not for immediate use, but for exchange. The elementary form of wealth in capitalist society. Every commodity has a dual nature: use-value and value.
- - -
A commodity is any good or service produced for exchange rather than for direct use. It is the fundamental cell of capitalist production, the material form through which social labour is organized.
**Dual nature:** Every commodity has a twofold character:
- Use-value: Its utility or ability to satisfy a human need or desire. . It is qualitative, realized only in use or consumption, and independent of the quantity of labour required.
- Value: The social substance common to all commodities: abstract human labour, measured by socially necessary labour-time. It expresses the commodity as a portion of the total social labour of society.
	- Exchange-value:The quantitative relation, or proportion, in which one commodity exchanges for another. The form of appearance of value; the way value manifests itself in exchange.
**Non-commodities:** Goods or services produced directly for personal or communal use, without entering exchange, are not commodities. Their value is purely in use, not in exchange.
Behind the exchangeability of commodities lies human labour. What makes commodities comparable is that they all embody a portion of socially necessary labour time.
**Abstract Labour:** Labor stripped of its concrete, useful character, the pure expenditure of human labour-power. It is the substance of value.
**Concrete Labour:** Specific, productive activity that creates use-values (weaving, tailoring, etc). It gives commodities their material form.
**Socially Necessary Labour-Time:** The average labour-time required to produce a commodity under normal conditions of production and with the average degree of skill and intensity prevalent in society. It determines the magnitude of value.
### Commodity Fetishism
In capitalist society, social relations between producers take the form of relations between things.
Commodities appear to have value in themselves, as if they possess an intrinsic power to exchange, rather than that power arising from human labour and social cooperation.
Relations between people appear as relations between things, It mystifies the real social character of labour and makes the products of labour seem autonomous.
The commodity seems to possess value “in itself,” obscuring the human labour that constitutes it.
### Social relations of production:
Under capitalism, most people do not own the means of production. They must sell their labour power to those who do (the capitalist class) who then control and direct production.
We are surrounded by commodities that embody our collective labour, but which confront us as alien objects: products we did not freely choose to create, circulating for profit rather than for human need.
## Money
Money is the one commodity that expresses the value of all other commodities. The finished form of the value-form; the universal equivalent that expresses the value of all commodities. It serves as measure of value, medium of circulation, means of payment, hoard, and world money.
- - -
The universal equivalent, and general form of value. Can be exchanged for other commodities. 
It is a **medium of exchange and a measure of value**, it allows us to compare the exchange value of different commodities.
Money represents the amount of socially necessary labour time that a commodity embodies, but in a standardized and symbolic way.
Money allows the split between selling and buying (C->M->C). Instead of direct barter, commodities first transform into money, which then purchases another commodity.
Because money holds value over time, it lets exchange be delayed and accumulation occur. This storage function is essential for the rise of capital.
Once money is not merely used to buy goods for use (C->M->C), but to buy in order to make more money (M–C–M′), it becomes **capital**. This shift introduces the self-expanding logic of value that defines capitalism.
Money obscures the social labour that produces commodities by making all things commensurable, everything becomes comparable in quantitative, monetary terms.
**Price:** The money-name of the labour contained in a commodity. It expresses value in the money-form, though it can deviate from actual value. 
**Medium of Circulation:** Money acting as the intermediary in the metamorphosis of commodities (C->M->C), where one commodity is exchanged for another through money.
**Coin:** Money as it actually circulates. Its material substance (gold) can be replaced by tokens or paper money, since in this function money is purely symbolic.
## Exchange
Effected by the socially necessary labour time in society produce it.
Exchange is the social process through which private labors become part of the total social labour. Only through exchange do individual acts of production acquire a socially recognized value.
In exchange, commodities relate to each other as equal expressions of human labour, even though the concrete labor that produced them differs. Exchange abstracts from specific work and recognizes only abstract labor (labor in the general human sense).
In commodity exchange, producers appear independent and equal, but their social interdependence is mediated by the market rather than by conscious cooperation. This creates the illusion of freedom, masking material dependence.
**Means of Circulation:** Money functioning as the transient expression of exchange-value between commodities.
**The twofold movement of exchange:** The unity of these two constitutes circulation.
- C–M: sale of a commodity. 
- M–C: purchase of another commodity.
**Exchange circuits:** The difference between these two circuits reveals the transformation of exchange from a social necessity into a means of exploitation.
- The circuit of commodities: C->M->C (Commodity → Money → Commodity)
	The exchange of one use-value for another through money. The end is consumption.
- The circuit of capital: M->C->M' (Money → Commodity → More Money)
	Money advanced to return as an augmented sum (M′ = M + ΔM). The end is valorization, not use.
Exchange presupposes smooth conversion between money and commodities, but when that breaks down (money hoarding or overproduction), circulation halts and exposes capitalism’s instability.
**Hoarding:** Money withdrawn from circulation and stored as a potential claim on social labour. The primitive form of capital accumulation.
## Value
The value of a commodity is determined by the **socially necessary labour time** required to produce it: The average amount of labour, under average conditions, with average skill and intensity, in a given society. Value comes from **labor in the abstract:** The reduction of all work to human time expenditure. Capitalism makes this abstraction concrete by constantly comparing and exchanging different labors.

**Value-Substance:** Abstract labour as the inner content of value.
**Form of Appearance:** The outward, phenomenal form through which an inner essence—such as value—appears (e.g., exchange-value is the form of appearance of value).
**Equivalent Form:** The position a commodity occupies when it expresses the value of others. Its own use-value becomes the form of appearance of value.
**Relative Form of Value:** The position a commodity occupies when its value is expressed in another commodity. It is value expressed relatively in another use-value.
**Measure of Value:** Money expresses the value of commodities as prices, imaginary quantities of gold representing the labour-time embodied in them.
Use-value vs. Exchange-value: Every commodity has both:
- Use-value → qualitative, satisfies a need; tied to material properties.
- Exchange-value → quantitative, represents a ratio at which commodities exchange, expressing the social dimension of labour.
Every act of labour in a commodity economy is both concrete (making a specific thing) and abstract (creating value). This duality is the key to understanding capitalism.
Determined not by how much labor was put in by a particular worker, but by how much labour society on average requires. Productivity increases lower the value of goods even if individual effort remains high.
**Value-Form:** The social form in which value appears. It develops through four stages as it's social character solidifies into the money-form.
1. Simple (x commodity A = y commodity B)
2. Expanded (A = B = C = D …)
3. General (many commodities express value in one commodity, e.g. gold)
4. Money form (gold or money becomes the universal equivalent).
Value isn’t a property inside objects; it’s the form of social relations under capitalism: Human labor organized through market exchange. Commodities seem to contain value, but in fact they embody social relations between people.
