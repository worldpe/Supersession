#Philosophy/Marx [[Marx]]
The proletariat is a historically produced class created by industrial capitalism, that capitalist progress simultaneously generates wealth and misery, and that modern class struggle arises not from injustice alone but from the structural transformation of production, making the abolition of capitalism a historical necessity.

The proletariat comes into existence only with large-scale industry and machinery. The proletariat is not defined by poverty, but by propertylessness + dependence on wages. This condition emerges historically, through mechanization, expropriation of small producers, and concentration of capital.
	Classes are historically constituted social relations, not timeless groups.
During the Industrial Revolution, productivity explodes, wealth increases and national power expands. But simultaneously, independent producers are destroyed, security of life disappears, workers lose control over labor and time, and social reproduction becomes precarious.
	Technical progress under capitalism deepens class antagonism rather than resolving it. Machinery functions as a weapon of class domination; It disciplines labor, cheapens labor-power, and creates surplus populations.
Industrial capitalism annihilates the independent handicraftsman and produces a polarized society with two main classes (capitalists and proletarians).
	The proletariat is no longer a transitional condition but a fixed class position.
Only when the proletariat becomes a permanent class does it become capable of an independent movement.
	Dispersed rural workers cannot organize and independent producers do not form a collective class.
	Concentration, misery, and shared conditions force awareness
Bourgeois politics is structurally incapable of solving the social question. Parliament is increasingly forced to discuss labor issues and reforms proliferate, yet misery deepens. The bourgeoisie cannot address exploitation without abolishing itself.
	The bourgeoisie must deny responsibility for poverty, and treats worker's interests as partial rather than universal.
