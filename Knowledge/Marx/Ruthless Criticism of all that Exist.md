"Ruthless both in the sense of not being afraid of the results it arrives at and in the sense of being just as little afraid of conflict with the powers that be."
	The first task of philosophers is critique without dogma. Criticism must be fearless, open to wherever truth leads, even if it challenges existing powers or one’s own assumptions.
	This ruthless criticism is not merely theoretical but directed against real social and political institutions. 
	The starting point of Marx’s politics is **critical consciousness**, exposing contradictions in existing society rather than preaching ready-made solutions.
"Therefore I am not in favour of raising any dogmatic banner"
	Utopian socialists present communism as an abstract ideal, instead of a process arising from the contradictions of real society.
	Marx’s communism is not a doctrine but a critical and historical movement. It emerges out of real struggles. 
	It’s discovered through the critique of the old world, not proclaimed in advance.
"We do not confront the world in a doctrinaire way with a new principle: ‘Here is the truth, kneel down before it!’ We develop new principles for the world out of the world’s own principles"
	Intellectuals do not invent revolutionary truths and deliver them to the masses: the point is to clarify what the world itself is already struggling toward.
	Revolutionary theory emerges from practice, from the self-activity and contradictions of the existing world.
	**Immanent Critique:** Starting from the self-understanding of society and exposing its contradictions, rather than imposing external ideals.
"The reform of consciousness consists only in making the world aware of its own consciousness, in awakening it out of its dream about itself."
	The self-awakening of humanity is a process where people come to understand the meaning of their own actions. This is not education from above, but a dialectical process of making implicit struggles explicit.
	Theology is a projection of human essence, as per Feuerbach. Politics and ideology are similarly unconscious expressions of social contradictions. 
	True critique helps society become self-conscious, it reveals that humanity already possesses, in potential, what it dreams of. Revolution is thus the realization of existing tendencies, not an arbitrary break with the past.
"Religion, and next to it, politics, are the subjects which form the main interest of Germany today. We must take these, in whatever form they exist, as our point of departure…"
	Critics must begin from the real and concrete interests of their time and not abstract philosophy.
	By analyzing the contradictions within the political state, the gap between it's ideal and reality, one can uncover the social truths hidden beneath.
	**Critique of Political Economy:** the idea that each sphere of social life expresses deeper material contradictions.
"Just as religion is a register of the theoretical struggles of mankind, so the political state is a register of the practical struggles of mankind."
	Political institutions embody the conflicts and contradictions of society. Critiquing politics is therefore a necessary starting point for social critique.
"This is a work for the world and for us. It can be only the work of united forces"
	Self-clarification is a collective project of transformation that requires united forces, not solitary philosophical genius.
	It’s the collective self-consciousness of the proletariot.
	**Theory of Praxis:** Theory as a form of collective, transformative activity.
