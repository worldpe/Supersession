#Marxism
This take can be summarizes as "History will do the work", and it implies class struggle is this automatic condition that will come about after some sort of crisis. At a first glance, the intuition seems correct: Workers don’t need to know Marx, and they act because capitalism forces them to act, but at a second glance, this is replacing praxis with a mechanical process. 
There is two major misunderstandings on class struggle:
1) Liberal pedagogy: "Here is the truth, now believe it", that workers must be educated into communism
2) Structural automatism: " Consciousness doesn’t matter at all, the workers will do communism unknowingly", that workers will abolish classes automatically
Instead, revolutionary consciousness emerges WITHIN struggle, struggle transforms their understanding, this is why it's the 'real movement'. Crisis intensifies contradiction and forces struggle, but it can just as easily produce reaction. Struggle doesn't come pre-packaged with clarity. This is what organization is for, to clarify the real tendencies during the struggle. The proletariat does need to understand it's role through action. This seems counter-intuitive, but all this clicked for me after reading the wikipedia pages for the Chinese revolution, there you can clearly see that history is mess and not automatic, I previously read in cosmic determinism into actions, which led to confusion.
Marx himself doesn't actually solve the problem of what mediates between struggle and emancipation in his writings, proposed answers I think make the most sense are either councilism or vanguardism, but I would have to read a few things arguing for both position to decide for sure which I think makes the most sense. The short answer is that that the proletariat does not abolish class society because it knows a doctrine, but neither does class abolition occur independently of the proletariat’s developing self-conscious practice.
"The materialist doctrine that men are products of circumstances and upbringing, and that, therefore, changed men are products of other circumstances and changed upbringing, forgets that it is men who change circumstances and that the educator himself must be educated" (Third theses on Freurbach) — Mediation is self-educating struggle, not instructions from outside. The proletariat does not already know their historical task, the purpose of the communist party is to give the worker's organization clarity.
"Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past. The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the living." — This is Marx acknowledging the threat of ideological distortion and misrecognition in the movement.
"The social revolution of the nineteenth century cannot take its poetry from the past but only from the future. It cannot begin with itself before it has stripped away all superstition about the past. The former revolutions required recollections of past world history in order to smother their own content." — Mediation is historical experience, including defeat and error.
"But the working class cannot simply lay hold of the ready-made state machinery, and wield it for its own purposes"
"[The Commune] was essentially a working class government, the product of the struggle of the producing against the appropriating class, the political form at last discovered under which to work out the economical emancipation of labor. " — Discovered, it was an emergent political forms created in struggle, not deduced in advance.
"Every step of real movement is more important than a dozen programmes... by drawing up a programme of principles (instead of postponing this until it has been prepared for by a considerable period of common activity) one sets up before the whole world landmarks by which it measures the level of the Party movement." — 
Revolutionary praxis is collective struggle that simultaneously transforms material conditions, social relations, political forms, and the self-understanding of the actors involved.
The class exists before the party, political forms emerge from struggle, and consciousness is historically mediated, not institutionally stored. 	For Bordiga, the party is an ontological condition of class politics, explicitly separate from the proletariat, whose job is to criticize the masses in articles no one reads.
