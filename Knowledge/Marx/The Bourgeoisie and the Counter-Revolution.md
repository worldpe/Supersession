Both revolution and counter-revolution operate outside legality.
	Appeals to law are ideological tools used selectively by the ruling class.
Figures like Camphausen and Hansemann are not villains but functionaries of class interests.
	Personal incompetence is irrelevant, structural position determines behavior.
Pre-1848 liberalism was not pro-people but pro-bourgeois modernization.
	Popular slogans ("freedom of the press", "representation") masked class-specific aims.
The bourgeoisie needed the absolutist state to suppress workers once revolution radicalized.
	This is why it was willing to compromise with monarchy and aristocracy after getting concessions.
Fiscal crisis forces the state to negotiate with capital.
	Political reforms arise from material constraints, not moral progress.
The bourgeoisie invoked "the people" tactically, not substantively.
	Once mobilization exceeded bourgeois control, repression followed.
The bourgeoisie’s rise undermines feudalism, but once in danger from below, it becomes conservative.
