#Marxism 
The state is a historically necessary form of domination that cannot be reformed into an instrument of emancipation, but also cannot be bypassed; it must be politically overcome in the process of abolishing the social relations that give rise to it, after which it ceases to exist as a distinct power.

## Non-Anarchism
Anarchist treats the state as the primary source of struggle in society and assume abolishing political authority dissolves social domination.
The state does not generate exploitation, exploitation arises from relations of production. The state is a derivative expression of those relations.
When anarchist demand the immediate dissolution of authority, they ask for the power required to transition society to be destroyed: Property relations cannot be transformed without coercive rupture. 
Anarchism is historically impossible and utopian. You cannot change society with an act of will. The state will become superfluous as class antagonisms dissolve. Things are rarely ever abolished by decree, the power structure that require them need to be changed first.
I support social coordination without a coercive apparatus standing above society, with decisions embedded in collective control of production, and no separation between governors and governed
## Anti-Statism
"The state cannot abolish social misery because it is founded on the social relations that produce it."
	The state is not an independent agent
	It is not neutral
	It is not a tool that can simply be "used correctly"
	Do not mistake the state for the site of emancipation.
## 1. The State Is Not the Root Cause
Abolish the state without abolishing capital, and domination reappears in other forms.
	The state does not generate exploitation.
	Exploitation arises from relations of production.
	The state is a derivative expression of those relations.
Anarchism reverses this:
	It treats the state as the primary evil
	It assumes abolishing political authority dissolves social domination
## 2. Politics Cannot Be Skipped
Every revolution is a political act, the old ruling power must be overthrown, and property relations cannot be transformed without coercive rupture.
Anarchism wants the immediate dissolution of authority; Horizontal reorganization without transitional power.
	This is historically impossible.
## 3. The State Withers, It Is Not Abolished by Decree
The state is not destroyed as an act of will
It becomes superfluous as class antagonisms dissolve
Its coercive functions lose content
## Political Phase vs Social End
The state is a form of social organization, that arises from class antagonism, and exists to manage those antagonisms.
Phase 1: Revolutionary Transition
	State power is seized or broken
	Old ruling class is suppressed
	Property relations are dismantled
	This phase is necessarily political
**This is not socialism, this is a means, not an end.**
Phase 2: Social Reorganization
	Class distinctions disappear
	Coercive authority loses function
	Administration replaces domination
	Politics as such fades
## Administration of Things
Social coordination without a coercive apparatus standing above society
	Coordination != domination
Decisions embedded in collective control of production
	Administration != state
No separation between governors and governed
	Technical regulation != political power
