#Marxism 
## 1. Method, Epistemology, and Critique of Knowledge
Marx is not a philosopher of knowledge in the classical sense, but he does develop a distinctive critical method.
	Critique of abstract philosophy (especially speculative idealism)
	Critique of political economy as a form of knowledge
	The relation between:
	abstraction and concreteness
	essence and appearance
	theory and practice
	Historical specificity of categories
	Ideology as socially generated misrecognition
**Key ideas**
	Materialist conception of history (historical materialism)
	Determinate abstraction
	Real abstraction
	Fetishism
	Critique vs. positive theory
Status: Systematic but dispersed (especially in Capital, Grundrisse, German Ideology)
## 2. Ontology of Social Life (What Society Is)

Marx develops a relational and processual ontology, not a metaphysical one.
	Society as a historically specific ensemble of relations
	Humans as: natural beings, social beings, historically mediated beings
	Praxis as constitutive of social reality
	Production as the fundamental social metabolism
**Key ideas**
	Social relations of production
	Metabolic interaction with nature
	Species-being (early work, later transformed)
	Social reproduction
Status: Present throughout, but never formalized as a social ontology treatise
## 3. Political Economy (Capitalism as a Social Form)
This is Marx’s most systematic domain.
	Capital as a social relation, not a thing
	Value, surplus value, exploitation
	Wage labor
	Commodity production
	Money, capital, credit
	Profit, interest, rent
	Accumulation and crisis
	Fetishism and appearance forms
**Key ideas**
	Value form
	Abstract labor
	Surplus value (absolute / relative)
	Prices of production
	Tendency of the rate of profit to fall
	Fictitious capital
	Trinity formula
Status: Fully systematic in Capital I–III (though incomplete in execution)
## 4. Class, Exploitation, and Social Conflict
Marx treats class as structural and historical, not sociological in the modern sense.
	Classes as positions within relations of production
	Class struggle as historical motor (not a moral claim)
	The state as a class relation
	Political power as rooted in material conditions
**Key Ideas**
	Bourgeoisie / proletariat
	Class fractions
	Lumpenproletariat
	Class struggle
	Bonapartism
Status: Systematic in analysis, episodic in empirical elaboration
## 5. State, Law, and Political Forms
Marx does not produce a general theory of the state, but he analyzes political forms historically.
	The state as a condensation of class relations
	Law as a form of social regulation
	Political representation vs. real power
	Revolution and counter-revolution
	Constitutions, parliaments, bureaucracies
**Key Ideas**
	Relative autonomy of the state
	Executive power
	Bourgeois democracy
	Dictatorship of the proletariat (very limited treatment)
	Commune as a new political form
Status: Case-based, historically specific (18th Brumaire, Civil War in France)
## 6. Revolution, Social Transformation, and Communism
This is where Marx is least programmatic and most misunderstood.
	Conditions of revolutionary rupture
	Abolition of wage labor and value production
	Communism as a real movement, not a blueprint
	Transitional periods
	Class self-emancipation
**Key Ideas**
	Communism as negation of capitalism
	Lower and higher phases of communism
	Social ownership (not “state ownership”)
	Withering away of the state (implied, not theorized)
	Self-activity of the working class
Status: Theoretically clear, institutionally underdetermined
## 7. Party, Organization, and Political Practice
This is the most limited and deliberately non-systematized domain.
	Workers’ political organization
	Role of communists within broader movements
	International coordination
	Critique of sectarianism
	Opposition to substitutionism (implicitly)
**Key Ideas**
	Communists have no separate interests from the class
	Party as movement, not institution
	Critique of fixed programs
	Emphasis on mass activity
Status: Fragmentary, situational, non-doctrinal. Mostly in letters, polemics, and IWMA documents
## 8. History and Historical Analysis
Marx is a historian in method, not in the archival sense.
	Modes of production
	Historical transitions
	Revolutions and counter-revolutions
	Colonialism and imperialism
	Non-Western societies (later work)
**Key Ideas**
	Asiatic mode of production (tentative)
	Primitive accumulation
	Uneven development
	Historical contingency
Status: Strong analytic framework, uneven empirical coverage
## 9. Ideology, Religion, and Culture
Marx does not write cultural theory as such, but develops a critique of ideology.
	Religion as social expression.
	Ideology as material practice.
	Mystification of social relations.
	Culture as historically conditioned.
**Key Ideas**
	Ideology as inverted consciousness.
	Religion as opium (misread simplistically).
	Commodity fetishism as cultural form.
## 10. Nature, Science, and Ecology
Often overlooked, but real.
	Metabolic rift between society and nature
	Limits of capitalist production
	Science as productive force
	Agriculture and soil exhaustion
**Key Ideas**
	Metabolism (Stoffwechsel)
	Robbery of nature
	Material conditions of production
Status: Present but underdeveloped
## 11. What Marx Deliberately Does Not Provide
Marx does not give:
	A theory of the vanguard party
	A blueprint for socialist institutions
	A psychology
	A moral philosophy
	A theory of consciousness as such
	A fixed political strategy valid across epochs
These absences are not failures but consequences of his method.
