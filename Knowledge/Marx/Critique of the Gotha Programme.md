#Philosophy/Marx [[Marx]]
Socialism is not defined by fairness, equality, or rights, but by the transformation of the mode of production. Distribution follows production; rights reflect material conditions; and the lower phase of communism necessarily retains elements of bourgeois right. Only when material abundance and the abolition of coerced labor are achieved can communism transcend law, equality, and the state itself.
Attempts to "apply Marxism" that prioritize redistribution, legal equality, labor discipline, or state power over the transformation of social relations inevitably reproduce hierarchy, coercion, and alienation. This is the predictable outcomes of abandoning the materialist method.

You cannot will socialism into existence by declaring fairness. Socialism is not a moral ideal but a determinate historical form. Formulations like "fair distribution", "equal right", and "undiminished proceeds of labor" are bourgeois moral categories smuggled into socialism.
	Socialism is not about justice, but changing the mode of production. Distribution follows production, not the other way around.
	Any distribution whatever of the means of consumption is only a consequence of the distribution of the conditions of production.
"Labor is the source of all wealth." is theoretically catastrophic.
	Nature is a source of wealth; Labor only mediates nature. To treat labor as the sole source is bourgeois ideology.
Right can never be higher than the economic structure of society and its cultural development conditioned thereby.
	Even under socialism, equal rights would still reproduce inequality because individuals are unequal in capacity, need, circumstance.
In the lower phase of communism, distribution is according to labor contribution. Equality is formal, not substantive, and bourgeois right still operate.
	This is the transition, not the ideal form.
Equal labor-time exchange still reproduces inequality as more skilled workers get more, and needs are ignored.
	Planning + equality of exchange is not communism.
Only at a higher stage of communism once productivity is sufficiently developed, labor is no longer coerced and social antagonisms are dissolved, this is when society cane operate on the principle: "From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs".
	You establish abundance by decree.
The state is a form of class rule, even a worker's state is a transitional coercive apparatus, not an embodiment of freedom.
	Freedom begins where the state ends, not where it is perfected.
The dictatorship of the proletariat is a transition, not a regime type.,
	It is a historical phase, not a blueprint for governance.
Its function is to suppress the old ruling class, reorganize production, and abolish class conditions.

- Programmatic socialism collapses into moralism. Socialism defined as fairness and exploitation defined as immorality produces bourgeois socialism.
- Labor being treated as sacred anticipates forced labor discipline, the glorification of productivity, and moral pressure to work for the collective.
- Without changing production relations, redistribution becomes domination: When socialism is treated as redistribution of goods, equal wages, and state allocation instead of the transformation of production, you get managerial bureaucracy, administrative coercion, and stagnation.
- Attempts to constitutionalize socialism, guarantee equality by law, and define socialism juridically contradict the fact that law reflects material conditions, and that equality before the law masks real inequality. This is why you see persistent stratification in socialist states, privileges of party cadres, and reproduction of hierarchy despite formal equality.
- Transitional states often become entrenched, with "temporary" coercion becoming permanent. The state does not wither away because class conditions were not abolished, scarcity remained, and labor remained coerced.
- Skipping stages produces repression, as attempts to enforce need-based distribution under scarcity, abolish money prematurely, or suppress market mediation without abundance, has resulted historically with rationing, coercion, black markets, and repression. This is not because Marxism failed, but because it was ignored.
