#Philosophy/Marx [[Marx]]
## Preface
Socialists have a recurring ideological pattern that attempts to deduce socialism directly from bourgeois political economy without critically transforming its categories.
	Proudhon is guilty of that in how he plagiarizes Ricardo, but adds a friendly face.
	They take Ricardo’s labor theory of value and draws immediate moral or egalitarian conclusions from it.
Ricardo’s two core propositions:
	(1) Commodity value is determined by labor time.
	(2) Social product is distributed as wages, profit, and rent.
English socialists had already used these propositions decades earlier to argue that workers are entitled to the full product of labor. 
	Proudhon and Rodbertus mistakenly believe they are making original discoveries, when in fact they are repeating an already exhausted line of thought.
Communism is not based on moral outrage, but on the historical dynamics and contradictions of capitalism itself.
	Exploitation is unjust is a moral judgment external to economics.
	Demonstrating exploitation as unpaid labor structurally necessary to capitalism is a scientific claim.
	Proudhon treats bourgeois economic categories as eternal and then condemns capitalism for failing to live up to them.
The heart of Proudhon's utopian delusion is "constituted value", the idea that commodities SHOULD exchange according to labor time
	Proudhon proposes administrative or state measures (labor-notes) to enforce "just exchange".
	Such schemes preserve commodity production while abolishing the conditions that make it possible, which is incoherent
Proudhon’s ideas resonate with small producers whose labor is devalued by machinery and competition. 
	The dream of a society where commodities exchange strictly according to labor time appears as restored justice.
	Proudhon expresses the outlook of a historically doomed stratum
The Poverty of Philosophy is where Marx breaks decisively with utopian socialism, and clarifies the difference between moral critique and scientific critique.
	He begins systematically transforming political economy rather than accepting its categories.
