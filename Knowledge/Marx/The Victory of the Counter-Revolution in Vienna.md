The European counter-revolution succeeds because the bourgeoisie everywhere allies with reaction rather than risk proletarian victory.
The German bourgeoisie has a historical cowardice and dependency.
	In France, the bourgeoisie crushed the workers after securing political power.
	In Germany, the bourgeoisie collaborates with absolutism before achieving its own emancipation.
The bourgeoisie does not betray the revolution accidentally, it does so because proletarian emancipation threatens property relations.
Counter-revolution is coordinated through shared class interests, not national identity.
	Paris → Vienna → Berlin, repression spreads across Europe.
Reaction arms socially marginal layers against organized workers (proletariat vs lumpenproletariat).
Military repression cannot resolve contradictions rooted in economic structures.
	Financial crises and social breakdown will undermine counter-revolutionary rule.
Drawn-out, half-hearted revolutions lead to prolonged bloodshed.
	Concentrated revolutionary force would shorten the death agony of the old society.
Class struggle must be international, and bourgeois liberalism cannot be a revolutionary ally.
