Freud's main concept is essentially a false necessity. His main premises are, human instincts seek gratification, civilization requires repression, and therefore either instinctual satisfaction leads to chaos, or civilization leads to repression and unhappiness. This is a permanent and unavoidable conflict for Freud. But for this to all make sense, he has to do several things. First, he has to assume existing society is society as such, some sort of concept with time immemorial application. And two, he more or less assumes that capitalism is a natural condition of humanity, not a historical one. Now, if he was writing in, say, feudal times, he would probably be saying the same thing about feudalism. And it's because for Freud, he generalizes economic conditions to be so general that they're more or less interchangeable, because he's mostly just focused on the psychology of the people in the system. He's not focused at all on the system itself. That's why he only conceives of critics of the system as people who are victims of some sort of psychological discontentment, not as people analyzing the system itself. Because he doesn't analyze the system, so he deprioritizes doing so. That's why his analysis lacks rigor. He constantly refers to the terms like civilization instead of capitalism, because these terms are nonspecific enough and general enough that you can say tautological and meaningless things about it very easily. In fact, I might be misreading it, but he does kind of say that's what he's doing in the first five chapters of this very book, which is most of it. And then, once he stops doing that, and he does maybe what his point wants to make, it's just a rebranding of Christian morality, but secularized. Instead of guilty conscience, it's superego. 
All he really has is pessimism, and that results in him being an ideologue of domination, not an ideologue trying to understand domination, how to overcome it, because in his view, it's impossible to overcome it. I looked it up, and there are freudo-Marxists, I guess, but I don't even see what the point is, because if you don't, you already are rejecting most of what Freud is saying by saying you're a Marxist. So all you're getting from it is just his specific analysis of human psychology. But his analysis of human psychology puts far too much emphasis on subjective human experience. And disempowers what embodies and creates the experience. The domination that Freud talks about is in reality class domination. The constraint is exploitation, and the industrial civilization is just a historically specific form of this repression. In the past, repression was what's necessary due to scarcity, but with modern production, it's no longer necessary. Society could allow much greater instinctual gratification, and the only thing that blocks this is domination, not nature. But Freud doesn't go deeper than Marx. His biologism is not a more profound sociology. And history is not the history of repression. 
Freud merely just treats man as a biological constant, repression is universal, and civilization as a transhistorical necessity. This erases investigation into why these things are the case itself. If one is to accept Freud's model, there's no reason to investigate the phenomena of class or material social relations. Man is not a meaningful abstraction in itself. There's only just historical man in concrete social relations divided into classes. This is the only way that man becomes something you can intelligibly discuss. If Freud is right that civilization represses everyone equally, and repression is universal and tragic, it falls into an empty structuralism. Oppressors repress themselves just as much as the oppressed, and domination appears as a tragic necessity, not an exploitative relation. There are no agents of repression at all in Freud's theory, only a system, but logically, if there's oppression, there has to be oppressors. There has to be someone doing the oppressing. So this whole model where everyone's repressed by their roles just becomes an argument for ideological blindness, not a way of analysis. Repression is not a neutral tool, and this is an absurd claim to believe. It's a specific class-based political instrument that benefits some at the expense of everyone else. And Freud can't make this distinction.
Freudo-Marxists believe that you can use Freud for change, but according to Freud, you can't. There is no real political praxis you can derive from what Freud is saying, besides, I guess, vague liberalism. It has basically no application to class struggle. To practice, revisionist psychoanalysis is sterile, but so is Freudo-Marxism for ultimately the same reasons. It's just Freudo-Marxists are even more confused than revisionist psychoanalysis. At least they're doing it because ultimately they want psychoanalysis to be a big, neutral, non-political thing for a profit motive. That's the at least makes sense as a goal. I don't know what Freudo-Marxists think is going to happen once they figure out how to make Freud into Marx. I don't know what they believe this will create that's beneficial. But it more seems they're more confused than anything to me. You can't act on abstractions about man and civilization. You can only act on class relations. Capitalism represses human capacities beyond necessity, and liberation would transform not just work, but life and desire. Social misery does affect the whole person, but explaining this primarily in psychological or biological terms is missing the forest for the trees. Treating repression as a universal rather than class-specific phenomena makes it unintelligible, and you can't replace the analysis of class relations and class conflict with anthropology at all. The only thing Freud really can do at best is describe how domination feels. He can't explain how it works or why it exists, so his answers to those questions are completely insufficient.
