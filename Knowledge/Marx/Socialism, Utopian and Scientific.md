#Philosophy/Marx [[Marx]]
Socialism is not justice but a product of capitalist contradictions.
Dialectical materialism supersedes moral critique and speculative planning.
Socialism is neither imposed nor dreamed, it emerges from class struggle.
Socialism is not an ethical choice or intellectual invention, but the historically necessary resolution of the contradiction between socialized production and capitalist appropriation, made possible only by the material development of capitalism itself and realizable only through proletarian revolution.

## Utopian Socialism
Socialism emerges from real class antagonisms, but first appears in ideological form because the conditions to abolish these antagonisms are not yet present.
	Early socialism borrows the language of enlightenment rationalism (reason, justice, equality), even though its roots lie in economic contradictions.
The ideals of the French Enlightenment were not universal truths, but idealized self-understandings of the rising bourgeoisie. 
	Ideas are historically conditioned, not timeless.
The Enlightenment actually produced:
	Bourgeois equality before the law
	Bourgeois property as a "right of man"
	Bourgeois republicanism as "government of reason"
Bourgeois revolutions mobilize exploited classes, but do not rule in their interests.
	Proto-proletarian demands had erupted historically, but the proletariat is not yet historically developed enough to rule.
Utopian socialists diagnose capitalism correctly, but their critiques have a structural limitation:
	They see society as bad because it violates reason, not because it follows historically specific economic laws.
This gives the appearance that socialism is a plan to be imposed. Salvation comes from genius, persuasion, or example, and history is replaced by moral invention.
	Hence the term 'Utopianism'.
All three major Utopian socialists lack a fully developed proletariat, lack a theory of exploitation, and lack a theory of historical necessity.
	Saint-Simon still blurs workers and bourgeois producers. politics becomes "administration of production".
	Fourier uses dialectical insight and social critique but remains speculative.
	Owen grounds communism in productivity but still treats reform as a rational reorganization.
Utopian socialism treats socialism as an absolute moral truth  discoverable by reason, which is valid regardless of historical conditions. As a result, sectarian fragmentation and eclectic average socialism appears, without explanatory power.
	Socialism must become a science.
## Dialectics
Dialectical thinking sees processes, relations, contradictions, grasps things as historically developing, and understands change as internal, not accidental.
	Metaphysical thinking isolates phenomena, treats categories as fixed, and relies on rigid oppositions (cause/effect).
Reality itself is dialectical, and science increasingly proves this (evolution, astronomy, chemistry)
	Darwin matters not just biologically, but philosophically: species are historical, nature has a history, and fixity is an illusion.
Hegel restores dialectics, understands history as process, and grasps contradiction as motor of development.
	But he is an idealist, real relations are inverted, and ideas appear as driving force of history.
This creates an internal contradiction, as history has no final truth, yet Hegel’s system claims to be final.
	This needs to be inverted.
Not consciousness determining being, but being determining consciousness
	This allows history to be explained by modes of production and ideas to be explained by social relations.
Utopians denounce exploitation but cannot explain it.
	But scientific socialists understand that exploitation arises within equal exchange. Surplus-value is unpaid labor, and capitalism is historically necessary and historically limited.
Socialism is not a moral demand or blueprint, but the necessary outcome of capitalist development.
## Historical Materialism
All social structures are ultimately rooted in how people produce their means of life, and how those products are exchanged and distributed.
	Social change is not driven by ideas, morality, or reason but by changes in modes of production and exchange.
Ideas like justice, freedom, or equality arise after material relations have already shifted and become contradictory. When people start saying society is irrational or unjust, that is a symptom, not a cause.
	Revolutionary solutions are immanent to material conditions. They are discovered, not invented.
Capitalism was historically necessary, it smashed feudal relations, unleashed unprecedented productive forces, and created legal equality, free competition, and personal liberty (in bourgeois form).
	But capitalism as well creates conditions it cannot contain. Modern industry socializes production, but appropriation remains private.
	The core contradiction of capitalism is socialized production vs. private appropriation.
Pre-capitalist production: Small-scale, individual labor, individual ownership, appropriation matched production.
	Capitalist production: Collective labor, planned organization within factories, but chaotic, unplanned relations between producers, appropriation by non-producers (capitalists).
Production is social, yet products appear as private commodities. Society produces blindly, for the market, not for need.
	This is a structural contradiction, not an 'inefficiency'.
In commodity societies producers do not control social relations. The market mediates everything, and laws of competition operate behind the backs of producers.
	As a result, no one plans production socially, no one knows demand in advance, and crises are inevitable.
In capitalism, there is organization inside the firm, but anarchy across society.
	This is the contradiction between organization in the workshop and anarchy in society.
Machinery under capitalism increases productivity, but expels workers. This creates an industrial reserve army that disciplines labor and depresses wages.
	Technical progress becomes a weapon against workers, abundance becomes the source of misery, and labor’s product confronts labor as an alien power.
Crisis theory:
	Production expands compulsively
	Consumption lags structurally
	Overproduction is inevitable
	Crises recur periodically
Crises reveal:
	Capitalism’s inability to use its own productive forces
	Abundance alongside deprivation
	Labor and means of production idle because they cannot become capital
Capitalism responds to its contradictions by joint-stock companies, trusts and monopolies, and state intervention.
	These developments show production already requires social coordination, and that the bourgeoisie is increasingly superfluous.
But state ownership is not socialism; The capitalist state is still a capitalist machine, and exploitation continues.
	These forms only prepare the technical conditions for socialism, and force recognition of production's social character.
The proletariat is produced by capitalism itself, has no property to defend, is collectively organized by production, and suffers directly from the contradiction.
	Socialism is the necessary resolution of capitalism’s contradictions.
The state exists to manage class antagonisms, it is always the state of the ruling class.	It appears universal only because that class temporarily represents society.
	Under socialism, the proletariat uses the state to abolish class relations. In doing so, it abolishes itself as a class, and the state loses its function and withers away.
Under capitalism, social forces dominate humans like natural disasters. Under socialism, humans consciously regulate production.
	Bourgeois freedom is freedom from necessity; True freedom is freedom through understanding necessity. "From the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom."
