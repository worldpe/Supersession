## Private Property and Labour
At this point in time, critique operates at the level of human existence, not economic form-determination.
**Alienation** is not yet a systemic effect of capitalist social relations, but a directly lived rupture between worker and activity. 
	The worker experiences labor as belonging to another, as something suffered rather than enacted.
	Marx conceives of alienation as phenomenological here.
**Labor** is judged against a human essence, not merely against historical forms of exploitation.
	Marx treats labor as essentially a form of self-objectification, through which humans realize their species-being
	Capitalist labor inverts labor’s proper human function into self-mortification.
	This introduces a normative anthropology that is absent from Capital: labor ought to be the affirmation of human powers, not merely a means of survival.
**Communism** is the restoration of human essence, not merely a transformation of production relations.
	Humans are distinguished by their capacity for conscious, universal, and free productive activity.
	Alienated labor estranges humans not just from products or wages, but from their species-being
**Private property** is treated as the objectification of alienation, not the cause of alienated labor but its result.
	In Capital, private property is analyzed as a juridical expression of capitalist production relations.
Communism appears as a fulfillment of human essence, not merely as a new mode of production, a philosophical and ethical proposition.
**Exploitation** is framed as absolute and existential impoverishment. In capital it can coexist with rising real wages and material improvement, just relative to surplus-value.
## Private Property and Communism
**Communism** is defined positively as the restoration of sensuous life, as "Fully developed humanism", and "fully developed naturalism", and the resolution of philosophical oppositions (existence/essence, freedom/necessity)
	Communism in 1844 is a normative vision of human flourishing, in Capital it is a structural implication, not a goal described in human terms.
**Crude communism** is defined as the universalization of private property, equality as leveling-down, and community as universal capitalist.
**Private property** is said to reduces all senses to the sense of having, and makes objects human only insofar as they are owned.
	Alienation is sensory, perceptual, and affective, as opposed to deforming social relations of production.
**The man–woman relation** is treated as the most direct index of human development, sort of out of nowhere, as the ultimate way that humans relate to themselves through others.
**The Individual** and society are ontologically inseparable, and individual life-activity is inherently social. Consciousness comes up as a theoretical form of social life.
**Economic alienation** is the root of coercive institutions, and communism abolishes all estrangement simultaneously, instead of being fetishes.
Communism supersedes **atheism** by making God irrelevant. Philosophical debates about god do not show up later.
History is human self-production through labor, directed toward reconciliation. Communism is a necessary historical stage but not the final goal (humanism beyond communism).
## Human Needs & Division of Labour Under the Rule of Private Property
**Needs** are treated as expressions of human essence, and historically shaped. Capitalism produces new needs, but in a pathological form. 
	It expands needs quantitatively while impoverishing them qualitatively. Luxury and poverty are both alienated forms of need.
	In capital, needs appear primarily as conditions for the reproduction of labour-power.
**Division of labour** is the fragmentation of the human being itself. It is the reduction of individuals to one-sided organs. Labor becomes abstracted from personality, and hostile to the worker’s own development.
**Labour under private property** narrows life-activity and suppresses creative and sensuous powers. 
	Productive power grows while human richness shrinks, and wealth accumulation equals impoverishment of life.
**Competition** institutionalizes envy and turns relations between persons into relations between hostile needs. The social bond becomes antagonistic at the level of desire.
Capital produces needs in order to dominate, and makes individuals dependent on commodities for self-realization. Expansion of needs is not emancipation.
Division of labour precedes and underpins political domination, and fixes individuals in roles prior to law or state.
	Division of labour explained through the estrangement of activity, not the value-form.
	Division of labour violates the ideal for multi-sided human activity.
## The Power Of Money
This is actually the biggest divergence from his mature philosophy, here money is estranged human power, with the power to transform personal qualities into their opposites. 
	This reminds me of the thesis, antithesis, synthesis thing, where money is the antithesis of desire (thesis).
Money has a demonic ability to usurp human faculties, and is presented as a direct ethical inversion.
Money is the real social bond, replacing direct human relations, that controls the totality of society.
This critique presupposes a normative idea of human authenticity, that he does not endorse later.
## Critique of the Hegelian Dialectic and Philosophy as a Whole
Marx breaks away from Hegel and tackles why human beings experience their own social world as something alien, hostile, and dominating, even though that world is entirely produced by human activity.
	Humans create institutions, laws, ideas, economic relations, and social structures, yet these very same creations confront humans as independent powers, governing their lives as if they were external forces.
1. Humans externalize their powers (through work, thought, culture, etc).
2. These externalized powers take on an independent existence.
3. Humans then relate to their own products as something alien.
4. The more powerful the product becomes, the weaker the human appears.
Alienation is not an accident or a moral failure, rather it is a systematic process where human activity is separated from human control and returned as domination.
When thought treats itself as the true reality, real human activity is treated as secondary or derivative. Abstractions are treated as more real than lived experiences.
	In this condition humans lose the ability to recognize themselves as the source of social reality, and see the world as an unfolding of ideas.
	Human practice is reduced to an illustration of concepts rather than their foundation.
	This how he criticizes the idealist, alienation persists even at the level of philosophy.
Contradictions therefore cannot be resolved purely in consciousness, all you can do is declare that the contradiction has been overcome, it still exist in reality.
	This produces a false reconciliation, where people are told that harmony exists, but their lived conditions remain antagonistic.
	Philosophy cannot substitute real emancipation.
Simply negating religion, the state, or private property does not free humans, it is abstract and leaves real relations unchanged. Liberation requires humans to reappropriate their own activity as their own power
	Freedom is not achieved by declaring something false or illusory, but by changing how humans actually live and produce their world.
Human essence is not a thought, idea, or definition. It exists only through real activity. Humans become themselves only through sensuous, social practice.
	Philosophy cannot be the final form of human self-understanding, all it can do is clarify problems. The resolution of alienation must occur in life, not in theory.
	Philosophy loses its separate status once humans consciously organize their social life, which makes what philosophy tries to grasp abstractly transparent through practice.
Marx is arguing for a form of social life in which humans recognize themselves as the authors of their world. 
	In this way, social relations are no longer opaque or fetishized. 
	Institutions are understood as changeable human products, and individual activity and social power no longer stand opposed.
	Alienation ends when human beings no longer confront their own activity as something alien.
