Friedmanism rests on the fetishized appearance of a natural market order disrupted by state intervention, but markets themselves are socio-constituted forms of power-mediated coordination. The state does not distort this process from the outside; it stabilizes and manages the distortion created by market actors within it. 
A similar confusion appears in world system analysis, which presupposed peripheral economies as natural developing formations distorted by the core. These economies were constituted as capitalist through violent marketization and incorporation into the value form. There is therefore no pre-existing natural economy to restore, and solutions, such as delinking, identify capitalist domination as primarily external rather than as a social relation reproduced internally.
