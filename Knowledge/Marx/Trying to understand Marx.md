What is a class in practice? A class is not a sociological category, a self-conscious identity, a political subject, or a moral agent. A class is a structured relation within a mode of production that only sometimes becomes a political force. There are two class positions: class in itself, a group defined by its position in relation of production, and class for itself, a class that has become politically active through struggle, not through education. The class does not pre-exist struggle as a subject. It is not guaranteed to become revolutionary and does not act as a unified agent. Class is produced and reshaped through political struggle. This is why Marx constantly analyzes fractures within the class system, such as skilled versus unskilled, urban versus rural, employed versus surplus, national or segmented labor, and politically opposed fractions of the same class. How do classes act politically? Classes act politically indirectly, unevenly, and through mediations, not as transparent historical agents. Political action is mediated. Marx is very clear that class struggle is not reducible to voting, party membership, ideology, or conscious intent even. Instead, class power is exercised through institutions, alliances, representatives, and political forms that often represent class interests. Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please. Political forms do not map cleanly onto class content. Marx gives as an example the bourgeois ruling through monarchism, the peasantry supporting Bonapartism, workers supporting reactionary regimes, and revolutionary moments producing non-revolutionary outcomes. This is why Marx refuses the party is the class, class consciousness guarantees emancipation, and correct leadership ensures victory. Classes only act politically when material pressures intensify contradictions, existing institutions fail to manage them, collective practices emerge before coherent ideology, and political forms are improvised, not implemented. The Paris Commune is the paradigmatic case. Why do classes misrecognize their own interests? This is central, and Marx says it is far more subtle than false consciousness. The three reasons are: a) interests are not immediately transparent. Marx does not think interests are self-evident. Capitalism fragments experience, privatizes survival, individualizes risk, and mystifies social relations. So workers encounter capitalism as wages, not exploitation, as price, not value, and as competition, not class relation. This is objective, not ideological failure. Fetishism is not a belief error, it is a real social appearance. Political interests are historically contingent. What advances proletarian interests at one moment may block them later, stabilize capitalism temporarily, and produce contradictory outcomes. This is why Marx supports reforms tactically, opposes programmatic fetishism, and distrusts correct lines. There is no eternal proletarian interest that can be known in advance. Struggle precedes understanding. This is where Marx breaks decisive with liberal pedagogy. Workers do not become revolutionary by being told the truth. They do not need theoretical consensus to act. They do not act because they understand history's goals. Understanding is produced retroactively through struggle. The emancipatory eroding glass must be the act of the working class itself. The party's act, the theorist's act, history's automatic act, are not the case.

Revolution and social transformation is where Marx is sparse by design, not by omission. Marx just thinks revolution is a process, not a moment. It is the practical abolition of existing social relations. What mediates between struggle and emancipation? For Marx, the answer is not the party, ideology, education, or consciousness. The mediation is material transformation through collective praxis. The key mediations Marx recognizes are the breakdown of existing institutions, creation of new social relations in struggle, the reorganization of production and reproduction, and the dissolution of class distinction through practice. The working class does not expect miracles from the commune. They have no ready-made utopias to introduce by decree. Marx rejects future state models, organizational fetishism, and party metaphysics because social forms arise historically, political forms lag behind material change, and fixing forms in advance turns means into ends. This is why he criticizes the Gotha program, sectarian socialism, moral communism, and state socialism. Marx holds the revolutionary requires mass participation, emancipation cannot be delegated, organizations must emerge from struggle, no single form guarantees success, and political clarity follows practice, not vice versa. This rules out permanent vanguard, invariant party forms, council as metaphysical solutions, spontaneous about organization. This affirms openness, not indeterminacy. Most Marxist sects fail because they absolutize one mediation, such as party, councils, or consciousness. They confuse analytical categories with political prescriptions, and mistake Marxist's critique for a doctrine. Marx is not a system builder.
