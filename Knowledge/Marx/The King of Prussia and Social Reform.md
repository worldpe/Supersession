The state cannot abolish social misery because social misery is rooted in civil society itself, and the state is structurally dependent on that society.
	The state is not an external regulator standing above society, it is the official, political expression of civil society.
	Therefore, it cannot eliminate the conditions on which it rests without abolishing itself.
There is a systematic pattern in how states explain social evils, whenever confronted with poverty or unrest, the state locates the cause in:
	(1) Natural laws (Malthusian population theory)
	(2) Moral failure (lack of Christian feeling, laziness of the poor)
	(3) Administrative defects (bad policy execution)
What it never identifies as the cause:
	(1) Private property
	(2) The organization of production
	(3) Class relations within civil society
This is not an accident or bad faith, rather it is structural blindness: The state cannot perceive the source of social evils in its own foundation without negating itself.
**Administrative Impotence:** Administration is the organizing agency of the state, it is confined to formal, negative activity (regulation, discipline, punishment).
	It cannot intervene at the level where social misery is actually produced: labor, property, production.
	Thus reforms proliferate, bureaucracy expands, and misery persists or worsens.
	England is an empirical case: Centuries of poor Laws, ever-expanding bureaucratic machinery, pauperism as a permanent institution.
The modern state as resting on a constitutive contradiction: Universal interest (state) and Particular interests (civil society).
	The state exists only as the separation between public life and private life.
	Therefore the state depends on the very fragmentation and antagonism it claims to regulate.
	It cannot overcome this contradiction without dissolving itself.
Constitutional reform cannot resolve social antagonisms.
	political emancipation is not human emancipation.
Political understanding is structurally incapable of grasping social contradictions. The more "advanced" political understanding is, the more it mis-recognizes social causes. The French Revolution exemplifies this blindness.
	Political thought treats problems as matters of will, sees evil as a defect of laws or leadership, and assumes institutional redesign can solve misery.
	Social reality: Operates independently of political intentions, is governed by material relations, and produces effects that overwhelm political control.
Reforms do not abolish misery: they manage, discipline, and perpetuate it.
	Reform becomes a technique of social control, a way to stabilize capitalist society, a method of transforming misery into an administrative object.
"Why does the King not decree the education of all deprived children at a stroke?"
	Decreeing education, welfare, or employment would require feeding people, freeing them from wage dependence, and eliminating the proletariat as a class.
	To abolish pauperism, the state would have to abolish class society. To abolish class society, it would have to abolish itself.
**Political Revolution:** aims at state power, operates within the logic of the state, seeks inclusion, representation, rights, and organizes a dominant group at the expense of society.
**Social Revolution:** Aims at transforming life itself, targets alienated labor and private property, and proceeds from real human needs. Attacks separation from human community, not just the state.
	Human nature is the true community of man.
Political revolts appear universal but are abstract. Social revolts appear local but are universal in content.
	Economic revolt targets human life, political revolt targets citizenship.
	Destroying machines and account books expresses deeper understanding than constitutional demands.
Revolution requires a political act (overthrow); Socialism begins only when politics is discarded, it throws the political mask aside.
	Politics is necessary as a moment, but obsolete as a goal.
