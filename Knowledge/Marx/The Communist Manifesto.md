## Bourgeois and Proletarians
Capitalism is historically progressive, structurally unstable, globally universalizing, and self-undermining. The proletariat is not a moral subject but a social product of these dynamics, whose revolutionary potential arises immanently from capitalism’s own mode of reproduction.
communism is not a moral doctrine, a utopian plan, or a sectarian identity, but a theoretically conscious tendency immanent to the proletarian movement, defined by its grasp of capitalism’s historical limits. Communism is distinct from reactionary, reformist, and utopian socialisms by their relation to real class struggle and material conditions, not by intent. 
The communist position is strategically flexible but structurally uncompromising: it supports progressive movements without dissolving antagonisms, treats institutions as historically conditioned forms, and understands socialism as the abolition of class relations, including the proletariat itself, not the perfection of existing ideals.

History is the history of antagonistic social relations.
	Pre-capitalist societies had complex, layered class structures (orders, estates, gradations).
	Capitalism is historically distinctive because it simplifies antagonisms into two dominant poles.
The bourgeoisie is a genuinely revolutionary force in destroying feudal constraints.
	Capitalism is progressive relative to feudalism, not a moral aberration.
	Its destructiveness is inseparable from its productivity.
Exchange-value is the dominant social mediator, not moral or social values.
	Chartered freedom here means freedom of capital, not freedom of persons.
Ideology tracks real social processes, it is not arbitrary deception.
	Capitalism really does universalize markets, production, culture, literature, and communication.
	Cosmopolitanism is not false consciousness, it is materially produced.
All that is solid melts into air refers to the the speed at which social forms become obsolete.
	Beckoned by the permanent revolutionizing of production and the inability of capitalist society to stabilize its own relations.
The immanent contradiction of capitalism is crises, it is not a contingent malfunction.
	Crises occur because there is too much wealth, not too little.
	Productive forces outgrow the relations of property.
	Capitalism solves crises only by destroying productive forces, or expanding markets — which intensifies future crises.
The proletariat is created by capitalism’s development.
	Its characteristics (discipline, concentration, organization) are effects of modern industry.
	Class consciousness emerges unevenly, through struggle, not automatically.
	There is no assumption of immediate revolutionary awareness.
Machine-breaking and riots are immature forms of struggle.
	Workers initially attack machines, commodities, and local employers, not the relations of production.
Unions are not revolutionary, their significance is organizational, not economic.
	Unions are important because they centralize struggle, build organization, and create political capacity.
	Their immediate victories are temporary and limited.
The proletariat is revolutionary because it has nothing to conserve, it is structurally unique, not morally superior.
	Previous ruling classes sought to universalize their mode of appropriation.
	The proletariat cannot universalize wage-labour without abolishing itself.
Lumpenproletariat are not poor proletariat, they are defined by structural exclusion from production, not poverty.
	They are politically unstable and easily mobilized by reaction.
Inevitability = structural contradiction, not destiny.
	capitalism necessarily produces conditions that undermine its own reproduction, whether those conditions are resolved regressively or progressively is historical.
	"Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable."
	Politics is not unnecessary, and history does not guarantee socialism, it just creates the possibility to rebel against it.
This section is a historical sociology, not a program or propaganda.
## Proletarians and Communists
Communists are not a sect with a distinct interest, they are a tendency within the proletarian movement.
	Their distinction is theoretical clarity and strategic totality, not moral purity.
	This precludes vanguard elitism as moral superiority, and also reformist pluralism as neutrality.
The most advanced refers to grasping the movement as a whole, across stages, not intellectual or radical superiority.
	Communists represent long-term tendencies, not immediate sectional demands.
Communism changes the social character of property, what disappears is property as domination, not consumption.
	Capital is a social power, not a personal one.
	Personal property (use-values for life) is preserved.
	Bourgeois property (capital as command over labour) is abolished.
Freedom and individuality are class-specific concepts.
	He shows bourgeois freedom = freedom of capital.
	Individuality under capitalism presupposes dispossession of the majority.
		Capitalism: past dominates present.
		Communism: present dominates past.
Bourgeois outrage presupposes proletarian family breakdown already occurring.
	Family, morality, and religion are already hollowed out by capitalism.
	Communism does not destroy them; it removes the material basis that distorts them.
The described measures are transitional, not blueprints.
	Measures differ by country, and  are historically contingent, not timeless socialist policy.
	They outstrip themselves, and are self-transcending.
	This is not a theory of the socialist state or anything.
The state withers because class antagonism ends.
	Political power exists only as class domination.
	Once classes dissolve, political power loses its function.
	The proletariat abolishes itself as a class.
## Socialist and Communist Literature
Reactionary socialism criticizes capitalism from the standpoint of the past.
	Feudal and clerical socialism can critique capitalism accurately.
	Its reactionary character lies in wanting restoration, not analysis.
	This is why reactionaries sound anti-capitalist.
Petty-bourgeois socialism diagnoses correctly, prescribes backwardly.
	It accurately identifies crises, overproduction, and misery.
	But wants to reverse history, not supersede it.
True Socialism is philosophy severed from material conditions.
	Translating socialism into abstract humanism empties it of class content.
	This allows it to serve absolutist states, pacify workers, and protect petty-bourgeois interests.
Utopian socialism is historically necessary and historically obsolete
	Early utopians were progressive for their time.
	Their flaw is not moralism but prematurity.
	Once class struggle matures, utopianism becomes reactionary.
## Position of the Communists
Communists are tactically flexible, strategically rigid.
	Support movements that weakens the existing order, without dissolving class antagonism into alliances.
Bourgeois revolutions are not opposed in backward countries.
	Where capitalism is undeveloped, bourgeois revolutions are historically progressive.
	But communists prepare workers to turn against the bourgeoisie immediately after.
The property question is always foregrounded even when democracy, nationalism, and constitutionalism are the surface issues.
The ruling class will not relinquish power voluntarily.
