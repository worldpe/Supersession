This is how my debate with dealer on communism went:
He believes Marx is wrong and communism is a utopian ideal, and his main argument for this position is that a global economic order is a utopian fantasy. 
- I countered that we currently live in a global economic order right now —so you best start believing they're not a utopian fantasy. He then argued that there is no global capitalist order, which I did not anticipate.
- He gave the example of how North Korea is isolated from the world, a 'pariah state', however, North Korea is one of the number one receivers of aid in the world. As well, North Korea trades with other countries, they're a big exporter of coal to China, for example, so obviously, they participate in the global capitalist economy.
- Then he said, South Sudan is an isolated pariah state. I looked them up, and South Sudan actually exports oil, it's like 60% of their exports, so they also participate in the global capitalist system.
- I think he was using Google Gemini to list countries that aren't part of global capitalism during this, as  he eventually found a country: It's a tiny landlocked dictatorship in like the middle of Africa, with less people live in than like a county in an American state. It is a dictatorship and one of the poorest countries in the world, and it doesn't participate in the global economy. From this he concludes there is no global economy.
- Ironically, you can't even deny the global economy exists without referencing it, because it's so obviously true. How is it utopian to believe in global economic cooperation when the only country that apparently disproves this concept in the world is the poorest country on earth and is a dictatorship? (two outcomes he outwardly rejects as ideal) Once whoever is in charge of it dies or loses power, it will probably crumble and then they'll become part of the global economy, and this "utopian fantasy" will be realized.
- He then had to resort to saying that I don't understand his argument — to an extent that is true — his alternative formulation he presented what that the global economy was a "fluid motion", a term he never even defined. I think this is just some sort of post-modern talking point, but repurposed for "red pilled" purposes.
- He also argued that in the USSR, they were not ecologically friendly, and other things, but everything he said about the USSR applies to every single other large nation, and he was unable to qualify why they're notably bad, outside of some moral grandstanding about a river in Kazakhstan. I find this ironic, he brands himself as this hardcore right wing nationalist, but as soon as a nation with large power does something bad, he becomes a liberal, and can't make a structural criticism of it, and must resort to moralism.
His argument overall was very weak, and actually at the end, he conceded that capitalism will eventually be replaced, he just doesn't believe communism is better on these shockingly flimsy grounds. His name is literally "anti-communist", so I was expecting someone who can go for the jugular of Marxism, and I got someone only capable of incoherent post-modern and liberal hand wringing.
