#Philosophy/Marx [[Marx]]
Bauer’s error lies in confusing political emancipation with full human emancipation: Political emancipation does not require the abolition of religion, nor does religion prevent political freedom. Religion persists because political emancipation leaves intact the alienated structure of social life. Jewish emancipation is therefore possible within the modern state, but it reveals the limits of political freedom itself. 
## Bauer
For Bauer, the Jewish question is really about the contradiction between religion and political emancipation, and he concludes that neither Jews nor Christians can be politically free so long as they remain religious. Political emancipation requires religious self-abolition.
1. Jews demand political (civic) emancipation.
2. But Germany itself is not politically emancipated
3. Therefore Jews should not demand special emancipation.
4. The Christian state cannot emancipate Jews unless it renounces Christianity.
5. Jews cannot be emancipated unless they renounce Judaism.
6. Therefore, emancipation requires the abolition of religion itself
_"We must emancipate ourselves before we can emancipate others."_

## Religion Survives Political Emancipation
Bauer’s entire analysis rests on a false identification, he treats political emancipation as if it were equivalent to human emancipation. And because of this, demands conditions (abolition of religion) that do not follow from the nature of political emancipation itself.
Bauer criticizes the Christian state, but the real issue is the state as such and its relation to civil society.
	Political emancipation: emancipation within the modern state.
	Human emancipation: abolition of alienation in social life itself.
In the United States, political emancipation is most fully realized. There is no state religion, no religious qualifications for citizenship, and formal equality before the law. But religion not only persists, it flourishes.
	Religion is not abolished by political emancipation, nor does its persistence contradict a fully developed political state. **Political emancipation does not require the abolition of religion.**
## Religion is a Symptom
_"The state is the intermediary between man and man’s freedom. Just as Christ is the intermediary to whom man transfers the burden of all his divinity, all his religious constraint, so the state is the intermediary to whom man transfers all his non-divinity and all his human unconstraint."_
Bauer treats religion as the cause of political unfreedom, but it is really a manifestation of deeper secular contradictions.
Religion expresses the split between individual and community, private life and public life, and the alienation of social power into an abstract political sphere.
	We do not explain political limits by religion. We explain religious persistence by the limits of political emancipation.
In the modern state, man lives a double life:
	Citoyen: Abstract, universal, equal, participant in sovereignty.
	Bürger: Private, egoistic, competitive, driven by property, need, and self-interest.
**Religion belongs to the sphere of civil society, alongside private property and private interest. When religion is privatized, political emancipation is complete.**
## Political Equality
When non-property owners gain the right to vote, they can now legislate laws that apply equally to property owners. In this purely political sense, private property appears abolished in idea, because political rights no longer depend on owning property.
However the property qualification for voting is the last explicit way the political system openly acknowledges property inequality. Once that qualification disappears, the state pretends private property no longer matters.
The state can only declare people equal politically if it brackets off their real inequalities. The state must assume private property continues to exist in society. Otherwise there would be nothing to neutralize politically. 
Political equality does not eliminate private property, it depends on its continued existence in civil society.
	**Political equality only works because economic inequality still exists outside politics.**
## The Political State
_"The perfect political state is, by its nature, man’s species-life, as opposed to his material life. All the preconditions of this egoistic life continue to exist in civil society outside the sphere of the state, but as qualities of civil society."_
	Species-life: man as a universal, social being (citizen, member of humanity)
	Material life: man as a private individual pursuing needs, work, property
	Civil society: the sphere of economic life, competition, private interests
In the political state man appears as a universal being (equal citizen, bearer of rights), and the state represents the collective essence of humanity.
	But all egoistic conditions (private property, competition, class division) are not eliminated, they are merely expelled from the state and relocated into civil society.
	So the state becomes morally elevated and universal in form, yet dependent on a non-universal, egoistic society beneath it to justify it's existence.
The state represents humanity in general, but it only does so by pushing selfish, unequal life into the private economic sphere.
In civil society, man believes he is autonomous, but in fact he is dominated by money, the market, and class forces. his individualism is illusory, constrained and fragmented. 
	**The state grants a fictional universality, while civil society enforces real particularity and dependence.**
## Rights of Man
The rights of man are not universal human rights in a substantive sense, but rights of isolated individuals, rights of separation rather than association, and rights that presuppose civil society’s egoism.
	Liberty: The right to do what does not harm others → presupposes separation.
	Property: The right to dispose of one’s goods at will → sanctifies private interest.
	Security: Police protection of person and property → insurance of egoism.
The rights of man do not transcend civil society, they codify it.
Jews can receive political rights as Jews. The rights of man explicitly include freedom of conscience and religious practice. The state emancipates itself from religion by becoming neutral, not by abolishing religion. 
	The contradiction Bauer attributes to Jews is actually a general contradiction of political emancipation.
## Political Emancipation
Political emancipation is a great historical achievement: It abolishes feudal privileges and religious exclusion, and it universalizes formal equality.
	But it does not abolish alienation, overcome egoism, or realize genuine human community.
	Political emancipation frees the state from religion, not man from religion.
Human Emancipations requires overcoming the split between citizen and bourgeois, reclaiming social power from the abstract state, and transforming private social powers into conscious, collective human powers.
Human emancipation occurs only when social relations are no longer mediated by abstract political forms, and individuals no longer confront their own collective power as an alien force.
