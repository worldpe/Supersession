## Introduction
The poor had little access to schools, which were underfunded, elitist, and heavily biased toward the middle and upper classes. The socialist movement tried to fix this by promoting literacy and free education, but often did so in a paternalistic way, treating workers as passive recipients of knowledge rather than active participants in learning.
Everyone is already cultured: Knowledge and experience is already possessed by people, the task of education is to develop and discipline the understanding people already have so they can think critically and become intellectually independent. Education should help the working class achieve self-mastery and liberation, allowing them to lead their own movement rather than rely on elite career intellectuals.
The Popular Universities only offered scattered bits of knowledge, that oversimplified the concepts and made it so that workers could not possibly hope to engage with the academic elite due to how it distorts the meaning of the ideas. Workers should be challenged to understand difficult concepts.
He saw two goals for education, which should be a fusion of education on manual and intellectual labor:
**Schools of Labour:** Institutions that train a modern proletariat capable of mastering industrial and technical skills.
**Humanistic education:** Teaching workers the humanities and critical thinking so they become well-rounded, conscious individuals, not just machines for labor.
Revolutionary culture is the key to transforming society: Avant-garde movements like Futurism are progressive for rejecting the old traditions of bourgeois art (Although he later revised this view).
Education should be a tool of emancipation and collective intellectual independence for the working class.
## Socialism and Culture
Culture doesn't mean collecting encyclopedic knowledge, that merely produces pedants who see themselves as superior because they know things, but who are really disconnected from life and the working class.
True culture is 'organization, discipline of one’s inner self', the process that one becomes aware of their own value, purpose, and role in history. Culture is a matter of developing critical consciousness, not accumulating data.
Humans change through conscious effort and reflection. History progresses through people becoming aware of their condition and acting collectively to transform it. Socialism won’t arise naturally from poverty or exploitation, it will arise from cultural and intellectual struggle of workers who understand why they are oppressed and how to change it.
Before any social revolution, there is always an intense labor of criticism: a cultural awakening that prepares people for change. The Enlightenment preceded the French Revolution: philosophers and writers like Voltaire and Diderot created an international 'spiritual revolution' that made the political revolution possible. For a socialist revolution to occur, it must create a proletarian Enlightenment, a broad, critical culture that unites and prepares the working class.
The proletariat must achieve self-consciousness, knowing themselves, through knowing others (understanding history, other classes, and other cultures), because only through that knowledge can workers understand and shape their own destiny.
Thee working class can only become a ruling class if it creates its own culture based on solidarity, critical though and awareness of history. This culture allows workers to move beyond spontaneous revolts against oppression and to build a conscious, disciplined movement for transformation.
## Schools of Labour &  
The Italian education system serves the bourgeoisie, not the people. The state pours money into classical schools that train lawyers, bureaucrats, and white-collar professionals, not productive workers. Technical and vocational education is underfunded and neglected, so Italy has to import technicians and loses skilled work and wealth to other countries. The state favors administration over production, rhetoric over skill, privilege over merit.
Italy’s future depends on improving production, not just managing or distributing wealth. A modern socialist society must educate people to be technically competent, disciplined, and inventive. He calls for an education that develops both intellectual and manual abilities. Socialism must value and institutionalize productive culture: the science, skill, and dignity of work.
Middle and high schools are financed by taxes paid by the working class, yet only bourgeois children can attend because they can afford years of study. Talented working-class children are excluded or forced to become autodidacts. The state should support poor but gifted students, so everyone is equal before culture, education must be a right and not a privilege.
The state should be pressure to redirect resources toward working class education to transform civil society and form a new kind of human being.
## Men or Machines?
The worker is above all, a man, and must be free to explore the widest realms of the spirit; schools must also develop general culture, critical thinking, and philosophical reflection.
When bourgeois industrialists attack philosophy as useless, it's because critical thought threatens their power. The battle between humanistic and vocational camps mirrors the broader struggle between capital and labour, bureaucracy and production, privilege and merit.
The proletariat must stay alert to prevent new abuses: education policy is a political battlefield. Only by transforming education can the proletariat build the intellectual and moral independence needed to lead society.
## The Popular University
The popular universities are neither universities nor popular. But are unable to attract public attention or respect. Its leaders act from a mild and insipid spirit of charity, not a genuine desire to contribute to the spiritual raising of the multitude. 
The directors copy bourgeois education without method or spirit. They treat adult workers as if they were already-educated students, and create courses of dogmas and absolute truths, instead of living processes of discovery. **Popular education must instead reproduce the living process of discovery**.
True teaching should reproduce the effort of research over the centuries showing how from error one arrives at scientific truth. The history of research is what truly educates, giving learners that elasticity of methodical doubt which makes an amateur into a serious person.
Good teaching is an act of liberation and has the fascination of all vital things, awakening curiosity and modesty and preventing the formation of 'irritating know-it-alls'. The Popular University, by contrast, offers useless and unwieldy courses that impress rather than teach.
## Illiteracy
Because daily life is confined to conversations in dialect there is no need to learn to read and write. Illiteracy persists because it is not needed in the narrow, local existence of most people.
The law is an imposition: it can oblige you to go to school but it cannot oblige you to learn. Legal measures create external pressure, but no inner motivation or lasting transformation.
Socialist propaganda has done more towards literacy than all the laws on compulsory schooling by teaching people to see themselves as citizens of a wider world. This wider consciousness creates a real purpose for reading, writing, and learning.
Learning must connect to lived social needs of understanding and participating in society, rather than being a mere duty or ornament. Socialism alone can make true citizens by drawing people out of their little personal interests into a collective, conscious humanity.
## The Problem of School
The problem of the school must be studied as part of the sphere of action of the new state of workers’ and peasants’ councils. Education must be understood not within the bourgeois order but as part of the new social construction emerging from this state.
The educational propaganda conducted so far by the socialists has been largely negative and critical, but it can and must be otherwise. Marxists must shift from mere denunciation of bourgeois schooling to positive, constructive planning for a new communist education system.
Adaption of Soviet educational experiments identifying universal principles suitable for workers and peasants everywhere, must be developed.
In a bourgeois state there can be no technical and political solution to the problem of the school. Education ministers are chosen through partisan intrigue, not for competence. The bourgeoisie takes no interest in the school: it lacks a coherent educational vision, leaving schools to decay under bureaucratic mismanagement. Bourgeois schooling is lifeless.
The success of communist education is tied to the success of the communist state itself. Schools will train people in the practice of social discipline necessary for the realization of communist society, linking education directly to democratic participation and collective self-government.
The school will have the task of rearing the new generations who will reap the fullness of international communist democracy.
Students, artists, and teachers of different levels must help construct this new education system, including curriculum, administration, and the transformation of universities and law faculties.
## Questions of Culture
The proletarian revolution must be total, not just political or economic: It must transform every sphere of life and it is not only about taking power, but also about creating a new civilization — a distinct proletarian culture.
The working class must develop its own standards, feelings, and intellectual life, which will become dominant when the proletariat becomes the ruling class. Cultural organization is a necessary part of revolution.
The proletariat must organize itself culturally, just as it organizes itself politically and economically. Even before the bourgeois system is overthrown, workers must lay the groundwork for a new civilization by asking and studying cultural questions. This is what movements like Proletkult in Russia were attempting to do: create an organized system of working-class cultural production.
Critical communism interprets history through class struggle, but after the abolition of classes, there will no longer be historical development. Many workers must have asked this question and thus have their own metaphysical needs. Abolishing classes does not mean the end of struggle, rather just the end of struggles between humans. The new struggle will be against nature and necessity, carried out collectively and rationally. This new kind of struggle will require a new spirit and new ways of feeling and thinking.
The new school will undoubtedly be a crucible where the new spirits will be forged, the place where the new social and cultural type of human being is formed. In Russia, this is already visible: schools and workplaces are united; study is labor and labor is study.
To truly become a ruling class, the proletariat must produce and control culture, not just seize factories or parliaments.
## Marinetti the Revolutionary?
Lunacharsky’s claim that Marinetti (a Futurist) was a revolutionary intellectual shocked the “'philistines of the workers movement", who associated Futurism with bourgeois decadence.
But groups of workers would defend the Futurists from the attacks of professional artists and litterateurs, This shows an intuition of an unsatisfied need in the proletarian field and a recognition that a new civilization must be created.
The proletariat knows it must found a new state elaborate, a new economic structure, and found a new civilization. While the political and economic aspects are more foreseeable the cultural field is mysterious and open-ended.
The coming proletarian civilization will have a poetry, a novel, a theatre, a moral code, a language, a painting and a music peculiar to proletarian civilization. Creating this new culture requires the destruction of spiritual hierarchies, prejudices, idols and ossified traditions.
To destroy in the cultural field does not mean abolishing material products but breaking with bourgeois traditions and hierarchies. Not to be afraid of innovations and audacities, even if early efforts are imperfect or crude.
The Futurists 'destroyed, destroyed, destroyed' bourgeois culture’s stagnant forms, and in that way they are revolutionaries. Their destruction mirrors, in the cultural sphere, what Marxists aim to do in the economic and political spheres.
Workers sympathy for Futurism shows they were not afraid of destruction, and had faith that they could create poetry, paintings and plays, like the Futurists. This represents confidence in their own historic capacity to create a proletarian culture.
