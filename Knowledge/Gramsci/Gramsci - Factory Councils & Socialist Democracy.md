#Philosophy/Gramsci [[Gramsci]]
## Introduction
Revolution in an advanced capitalist country cannot rely solely on urban workers or economic control of factories. It requires broad political organization, alliances with the peasantry, and a disciplined party to coordinate a national struggle.
	The **Modern Prince** (the revolutionary party).
	The **war of position** (a long struggle for hegemony, not immediate insurrection).
	The **worker–peasant bloc** as the social foundation for socialist transformation in Italy.
After WWI, Italy was in deep social and political turmoil, both the industrial bourgeoisie and the labor movement emerged stronger after the war. Strike activity reached historic levels and increasingly took on a political character and workers won major reforms, but agitation continued with riots against high living costs. 
In 1919, Gramsci, Togliatti, Tasca, and Terracini founded L’Ordine Nuovo in Turin. With support for the goal of transforming factory workshop committees into factory councils modeled on Russian soviets. Councils would elect delegates to ward committees coordinating all local workers, and eventually link with peasant councils to form a network of workers’ democracy.
By late 1919, FIOM and local PSI branches backed the factory council idea. In March 1920, employers launched a lockout, trying to break the movement. Workers responded in April with a general strike, but the strike failed because employers were united and militarized, while the PSI and unions refused to support the revolutionary action.
A new wage dispute in the engineering sector led to the mass occupation of factories across northern Italy. Workers maintained production under self-management, while the army surrounded but did not intervene. Prime Minister Giolitti used a tactical, reformist maneuver and promised a bill for workers control to calm the movement, to split revolutionaries from reformists by offering illusory concessions. The PSI and CGL leadership voted to end the occupations and limit demands to trade-union recognition.
Employers launched a counteroffensive, mass firings, blacklists, and repression of militants, Restoration of strict factory discipline. The bourgeoisie, frustrated by the state’s weakness, began aligning with the rising Fascist movement. The factory councils were destroyed by Fascist violence and employer repression. The defeat marked the end of the revolutionary moment and the beginning of Fascist reaction.
Reformist criticized the movement as too radical, while Bordiga saw the movement as economic gradualism, too focused on shop-floor control, not political power. He predicted councils would be reabsorbed by capitalism and become corporatist.
They had not built a national faction within the PSI to challenge the reformists and their mass-action focus made them politically isolated, but they still represented working-class autonomy and self-government, not mere unionism, and also rejected Bordiga's focus on top-down party control. The councils’ strength lay in mobilizing the working class from below, fostering political consciousness and collective power.
The movement was confined to the industrial north and it had failed to forge political links with the poor peasants of the south. The geographical isolation of the movement was fatal, and this failure prevented the creation of a worker–peasant alliance, leaving the movement vulnerable.
## Worker's Democracy
The embryo of the socialist state already exists in the workers organizations of civil society and these must be developed into a coordinated network of councils and committees, under the Party’s ideological guidance, to replace the bourgeois state. The dictatorship of the proletariat should thus emerge not as a top-down seizure of power, but as the culmination of grassroots democratic structures already built within capitalist society.
After the Russian revolution, immense social forces have been unleashed and socialists must find a way to discipline and organize them politically so they can develop into the skeleton of the socialist state. The question is how to meet immediate needs while also building the coming proletarian order.
The socialist state already exists potentially in the institutions of social life characteristic of the exploited working class (unions, party organizations, internal factory commissions, peasant communities). The task is to link, coordinate, and centralize these institutions into a highly centralized hierarchy of competences and powers while preserving local autonomy. This will create workers democracy that functions already in opposition to the bourgeois state: Dual Power.
The Party and the unions lead the movement, but their influence is often indirect, they cannot alone absorb the entire working class, therefore new organs of proletarian democracy must supplement them.
The Party should remain the organ of communist education and supreme power harmonizing the organized forces of the working class, but it cannot open its doors to undisciplined masses, it must remain selective and firm in doctrine, and it's goal is to help coordinate the broader field of working-class organizations.
The workshop (factory) commissions socialist clubs, and peasant communities are the centers of proletarian life we should be working in directly. The factory internal commissions should evolve from limited arbitration bodies into organs of proletarian power, replacing the capitalist in all his useful functions of management and administration.
Workers should elect delegates across categories and trades, leading to factory committees and ward councils. These ward committees would unify all types of workers and coordinate actions like strikes. They would evolve into urban commissariats, forming a network of proletarian governance under Party and union guidance.
This structure gives the masses a permanent structure and discipline and a school of political and administrative experience that will teach collective responsibility and class consciousness to prepare workers to exercise power delegated by free election and not imposed in an authoritarian manner.
Dictatorship of the proletariat must not remain a mere formula, it requires a new state rooted in workers own institutions and a recoding of all social life.
## Conquest of the State
The working class must create new institutions of power, rooted in production and everyday life (factory councils), instead of trying to take over the capitalist state. Only through this process can the proletariat achieve real autonomy, overcome reformism, and begin the transition to socialism.
Capitalism naturally concentrates both capital and workers, and this concentration produces the objective conditions for revolution: large, organized working masses living and working collectively. The new communist order will arise from this social and economic transformation.
Under capitalism, workers are formally free, but unequal in real power because of private property. Their survival depends on uniting: solidarity and combination become the essence of proletarian life. This collective organization (unions, parties) transforms the workers’ mentality from individual to communal.
The capitalist class achieves unity and discipline through the state, which expresses its collective will. Even when workers organize, their institutions develop within and are limited by this capitalist state structure.
Earlier socialist and trade-union institutions developed in reaction to capitalism, not independently. They were shaped by capitalist pressures and therefore contained internal contradictions, compromises, and reformism. This explains the collapse of the Second International during World War I.
Syndicalists erred by thinking trade unions were permanently revolutionary; in reality, unions were shaped by capitalist constraints. Their anti-political stance was still political, but detached from real conditions. Parliamentary socialists, by contrast, stayed close to reality but were absorbed by the bourgeois state and forgot their critical, revolutionary role. Both lost sight of the autonomy of the proletarian movement.
Marxists should not rush blindly into events but critically interpret history. History is both freedom and necessity. Revolutionary strategy must be based on understanding objective conditions and anticipating change.
Reformist socialists believe they can conquer the state and gradually transform it, but capitalist state is structurally built for competition and class. The socialist state must be a fundamentally new creation, arising from workers’ associative experience.
The workers, peasants, and soldiers councils represent the form of the future proletarian state. These are not parliamentary bodies but organs of direct democracy and production management. They embody the new socialist order, where producers manage production collectively.
The war changed the balance of class forces capitalism is weakened and workers are concentrated and conscious. But without clear organization, this revolutionary energy could easily be diverted into reformist channels. Therefore, the proletariat must build a network of councils disciplined, communist-led, and rooted in mass participation.
Revolution is not a miracle but a process of development and requires preparation, education, and institution-building. If this preparation fails, the revolution will degenerate into another bourgeois parliament and betray its goals. Only through organized, conscious factory and village institutions can the proletariat truly seize and exercise power.
## To the Workshop Delegates of the Fiat Centro and Brevetti Plants
The workers councils are the seeds of a new socialist order: By organizing themselves within the factory, workers begin to discipline, educate, and govern themselves, proving in practice that they can run production and society without bosses or capitalists.
The election of workshop delegates (representatives chosen by each department or workshop) at FIAT is a new, transformative form of workers self-organization. It shows that the workers are moving beyond traditional union structures toward a more direct, democratic form of power inside production. Other workers are inspired to follow; capitalists are alarmed. The movement is becoming visible and significant.
This idea responded to a real need already emerging among the workers. The new institutions are the natural product of capitalism’s development and the workers growing consciousness. This is a spontaneous yet historically grounded movement, theory and practice have converged because reality demands it.
Workplaces will replace the old directive bodies as the centers of social coordination. Factory organization must now develop not only for defense, but for reconstruction, preparing workers to govern production themselves. The factory council is thus a school for self-government, training workers in discipline, organization, and administration.
True discipline is voluntary, conscious, and collective, not imposed by bosses or property. By organizing themselves and cooperating freely, workers prove in practice that they can manage production more efficiently than capitalists. This exposes the obsolescence of capitalist authority: That a man works better than a slave. By demonstrating their ability to manage production, the workers show that the end of capitalist domination is near. Every improvement in worker coordination is a step toward socialism, not a compromise.
Workshop delegates have concrete duties: 
- Unite unorganized workers and bring them into the movement.
- Defend workplace rules and contracts, ensuring fair conditions.
- Adjust and improve these rules as technology and worker skill evolve.
- Collect data and knowledge to aid unions and central organizations.
- Promote education and create vocational schools within factories to raise technical and intellectual ability.
	Even these small administrative tasks have enormous revolutionary value, because they cultivate self-activity and leadership.
The capitalist's authority is based on the right of property, a privilege of the past. The workers authority must rest on the right of labor: the right of those who actually produce. This right expresses the free forces of the future, preparing to govern society themselves. The councils embody this transformation: from coercion to freedom, from passive obedience to active self-rule.
From individual workshops to factories, to cities, to a national Workers’ Council, the councils will form a network of proletarian governance. This network will coordinate production, organize class power, and eventually replace the bourgeois state. The councils are thus the embryo of the socialist state.
With discipline, faith, and organization, the workers are now on the great road of the future. The crucial task is to build consciousness and permanence in the councils so that revolutionary power can mature.
## Unions and Councils
The union represents organization within capitalism; the council represents the embryo of socialism. The revolution requires their synthesis, disciplined organization infused with revolutionary initiative, guided by the communist party, to turn the working class legal struggles into the conquest of production and of power.
Trade unions arise within capitalism as a necessary form of organization for workers, since labor functions as a commodity that must organize itself to regulate the market. The union’s structure becomes bureaucratic and centralized, developing a leadership that negotiates with capitalists and maintains industrial legality. 
**Industrial legality:** The system of contracts and regulated labor relations. This is a partial victory for workers, improving conditions but still representing a compromise within capitalism.
Unions can be either:
- Revolutionary tools, if they consciously use legality and discipline as means to strengthen workers organization and prepare for eventual revolutionary struggle.
- Or conservative institutions, if they treat industrial legality as permanent and defend capitalist stability.
Factory councils are direct expressions of workers power at the point of production. They represent the workers drive to take control of production, not just negotiate its conditions. Councils negate industrial legality; they are revolutionary institutions aiming to replace capitalist control with workers control.
The union enforces legality and discipline but the council breaks legality and pushes toward revolution. These two forces must coexist dialectically with the council respecting the union’s discipline enough to avoid disorganized revolts, but the union should be transformed by the revolutionary energy of the councils, preventing it from becoming bureaucratic and reactionary. Their relationship cannot be hierarchical, because that would sterilize the council’s revolutionary role.
The communists must work within both unions and councils to spread the revolutionary ideas and turn spontaneous rebellions into conscious revolutionary activity. Communist must fuse discipline (from the unions) with revolutionary creativity (from the councils).
Union officials see industrial legality as permanent, identifying more with employers than with workers. They misinterpret workers acts of rebellion as disorder instead of as expressions of class struggle. Therefore, when unions dominate councils, it becomes a reactionary force that suppresses revolutionary potential.
## Red Sunday
Red Sunday is the first concrete cell of the proletarian revolution developing spontaneously from historical necessity. The factory occupations reveal the workers’ ability to run society. In taking over production, they have already begun to found a new kind of state, a network of proletarian republics that can unite into a socialist government. What began as an economic struggle has become the embryo of the dictatorship of the proletariat.
The factory occupations have turned the world upside down: instrumental classes have become the ruling class inside production. They are organizing themselves, choosing their own representatives, and exercising authority collectively. This is something bourgeois ideology always claimed only the capitalist class could do. This event proves that workers can govern production and themselves, showing that leadership and administration aren’t natural properties of the bourgeoisie but socially produced relations of power.
The factory occupations are an educational and political moment for the working class. Normally, workers follow union leaders and act with discipline and solidarity from above. But once they take control of production, they are forced to think, plan, and act autonomously. This is the birth of proletarian political capacity: workers begin to see themselves as subjects of power, not as followers of others.
Each occupied factory becomes a miniature state or a 'proletarian republic' where workers govern production. Under capitalism, the factory is a despotic micro-state controlled by the owner; under worker control, this despotism is abolished. These illegal factory-states live within the shell of the old bourgeois state, but they embody a new type of power: workers self-government at the point of production.
If each factory is now a proletarian republic, won’t they naturally federate into a unified city-wide or national Soviet? This is the same process that occurred in Russia, where local workers councils united into a national workers state. The logic of these factory-states pushes toward coordination, centralization, and political power, forming the embryo of a new state structure.
Any genuine power must defend itself militarily, So the workers must now form factory militias. These would later fuse into a city-wide workers militia, parallel to the bourgeois army. All workers have a duty to defend the revolution, the defense must be organized militarily, not left to spontaneous chaos.
The bourgeois state governs through indirect representation and corruption, but the proletarian state would have every factory electing delegates with imperative mandates.
## Political Capacity
The referendum to end Red Sunday symbolizes the failure of spontaneity and formal democracy within the workers movement. The proletariat must trust its vanguard, not its temporary moods. Revolutionaries must have the courage to lead, not wait for mass approval.
Consulting the masses through a referendum gives the illusion of democracy but in reality destroys revolutionary initiative, because revolutions are not made by majority opinion but by organized vanguards, the most conscious part of the working class. Referendums valorize the amorphous mass and crush the vanguard, who actually lead and give the movement direction. Democracy paralyzes revolution by imposing proceduralism instead of decisive leadership.
Revolutionary workers must not lose faith or scatter after the defeat, Instead, they must analyze what happened and transform that experience into political consciousness. passivity and hesitation within the masses, organizational limits of trade unionism, and their own capacity to lead future struggles more effectively must be recognized.
The failure wasn’t due to repression or bourgeois reaction, it came from within, and an absence of a spirit of adaptation to higher circumstances. Adaption does not mean opportunism, it means the capacity to rise to the level of revolutionary responsibility when conditions demand it.
The proletariat’s prestige and historical position have advanced and it has become the real potential ruling class.
Deciding the revolution by mass vote is parliamentarian thinking, and not revolutionary. Revolutions are not authorized by assemblies, they are prepared and led by organized. Assemblies and parliaments ratify what’s already happened, not decide it.
Building a revolutionary leadership core inside the working class is required for the revolution. Build a centralized revolutionary opposition inside the unions, create a proletarian general staff capable of planning and directing mass action.
## Those Mainly Responsible
The failure of the 1920 factory occupations was not because the communists were too cautious, but because the proletariat lacked a unified, disciplined revolutionary party. 
Anarchist claimed that if the Turin communists had been anarchists, the factory occupation movement would have become a full-scale revolution. Revolution is not spontaneous uprising, it's the creation of a revolutionary government, led by a nationally organized party capable of directing mass action. Organization and leadership are indispensable, the anarchists idea of spontaneous revolt without a party is doomed to failure.
The factory occupations began under the initiative of union and reformist leaders, The Turin communists did not start it and were skeptical from the start. No preparation had been made, no clear revolutionary goal was defined, It was a reactive and confused movement. So when it escalated, it lacked the structure to transform into revolution. If the reformist leadership had chosen to make the occupations revolutionary, the movement could have spread nationally. But they refused because their goal was negotiation, not revolution.
If the Turin communists had begun the insurrection on their own initiative, they would have had no national support and been crushed. Restraint was not cowardice, but political realism.
The reformist briefly encouraged an insurrection not to win, but to create a bloodbath that would justify retreat and compromise, and the communists refused to participate in this 'infamous game'.
There can be no revolutionary action while sharing a party with people who distrust the vanguard, fear insurrection and sabotage from within. This is the ideological foundation for the split that created the Communist Party of Italy (1921).
"In September 1920 there did indeed exist anarchists… What did the anarchists do? Nothing." There was a national anarchist movement, yet they took no meaningful action during the occupations, because without organization and coordination, revolutionary energy evaporates.
There must exist a party which puts its national organization at the service of the proletarian revolution, and which prepares capable men who can see ahead, and who do not know hesitation or wavering.
## Once Again on the Organic Capacities of the Working Class
Many of the most militant workers from 1920 have been driven into exile or unemployment by repression. A new generation of workers has entered the factories , younger, with no direct experience of the 1920 movement. But the factory occupations remain a living memory among the people, as a reference point for class consciousness and discussion.
The occupations were a historical test that proved that the working class was mature and capable of self-organization, and the failure was not due to the workers themselves, but to their leaders, the Socialist Party, which was incapable and inept. The class passed the test, the party failed it.
Class memory and curiosity about Red Sunday persist, but political understanding is still incomplete, and it must be deepened by the Communist Party.
"The revolutionary impact of the occupation of the factories was enormous… The working masses saw in it a confirmation of the Russian Revolution, in a Western country more industrially advanced than Russia."
Workers organized their own management, replacing engineers and administrators who had fled. Despite reduced staff and resources, output remained stable or even improved. The occupations unleashed a wave of creativity, solving industrial and military problems with ingenuity. Workers rediscovered their humanity and creative powers through collective control over their own labor.
The structural limits of the occupation were lack of transport, finance, or national coordination, and lack of contact between factories. The workers councils remained local and economic, not political. Without state power, they could not fully reorganize production or society. These problems were beyond the factory level and required a revolutionary party and a workers government to solve.
