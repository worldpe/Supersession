## Structure and Superstructure
it is a mistake ('primitive infantilism') to think that every change in politics or ideology directly and immediately reflects the economic base or structure. Mechanical historical materialism is a crude determinism that sees ideology and politics as mere reflections or automatic effects of economic conditions.  The relationship between structure (the economic base) and superstructure (politics, ideology, culture) is complex, mediated, and dynamic.  
During a crisis, the ruling class may act in contradictory ways that express not the structure as it is, but as it’s becoming. Politics thus reflects a process, not a snapshot.
political actions can also be mistakes: Ruling classes or leaders may misjudge the situation, that must be corrected through crisis or re-alignment. Mechanical Marxists deny this possibility they assume every act automatically expresses the structure’s logic. Political life is full of contingency, calculation, and miscalculation, where structure sets limits but does not dictate every move.
Many ideological or political conflicts are driven by organizational needs. Ideology has a relative autonomy: it often develops around the need to organize and differentiate groups, not just to express material class positions.
