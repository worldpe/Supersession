#Philosophy/Gramsci [[Gramsci]]
# Introduction
The PSI when Gramsci joined was divided into the reformist and revolutionary wings, the reformist wing forged an alliance with the North Italian forces of production to subject under-industrialized south.
The 'Maximalist' (revolutionary left) used parliament as a platform for propaganda, but refused coalition or to view parliamentarism as the way to achieve socialism.
Gramsci identified with the underdeveloped and marginalized South of Italy, and was shaped by exposure to the most advanced and militant industrial working class made him highly critical of reformism.
when the Bolsheviks took power he wrote of 'the revolution against Karl Marx's Capital, seeing the revolution of happening in spite of the Second International orthodoxy. He felt it disproved the notion of Marxism as a gradually unfolding of impersonal economic laws.
In his view a more authentic Marxism was about collective popular will, not about the force of ideas in themselves or about mechanical fatalism of economic development.
For him, Marxism is about people becoming conscious of objective reality and with ideas finding the instrument of their realization in the material forces of production and in a disciplined working-class movement.
He defended the Bolshevik revolution from the argument it had forced a radical political solution on economically immature conditions.
	"It is not the economic structure (Base) which directly determines political activity, but rather the way in which that structure and the so-called laws which govern its development are interpreted ... Events ... depend on the wills of a great many people (and) on the knowledge a minority possesses concerning those wills."
Gramsci does not reduce the state to the expression or instrument of an already unified social class. He sees the mature bourgeois state rather as an arena in which conflicts between competing fractions of the bourgeoisie are regulated and the dominance of one fraction over the others is secured.
The task of the socialistist should not be to seek to perpetuate this bourgeois form of state, as the reformists ('collaborationists') were doing. Rather, the state needed to be replaced by a socialist state whose role would be limited to that of organizing production and exchange.
## Discipline
**Autonomous  Disciplines:** The very life, the very thought of the person who observes them.
Bourgeois discipline is the only force which keeps the bourgeois aggregation firmly together. 
Bourgeois discipline is mechanical and authoritarian, socialist discipline is autonomous and spontaneous. It makes people into subjects, and deludes them into believing that they exert an influence on the course of events.
Whoever is a socialist or wants to become one does not obey: he commands himself, he imposes a rule of life on his impulses, on his disorderly aspirations. Socialist discipline makes the subject into a citizen: a citizen who is now rebellious precisely because he has become conscious of his personality and feels it is shackled and cannot freely express itself in the world.
## The Revolution Against Capital
The Bolsheviks we the maximalist, a driving faction preventing stagnation, ensuring the revolution would not come to a halt and allow a final bourgeois settlement.
The Bolshevik Revolution consists more of ideologies than of events, that is, it changes the theory of revolution itself. It is a revolution of ideas, not events.
"This is the revolution against Karl Marx’s Capital". In Russia, Capital was "the book of the bourgeoisie", showing the predetermined course of history that must be followed. Capitalism must develop first, then the proletariat could revolt, but the Bolsheviks have broken this schema. "Events have overcome ideologies".
The Bolsheviks refuse to treat Marx's work as rigid doctrine of dogmatic utterances, never to be questioned, they are not Marxist but embody and live Marx's living dialectical thought.
For Gramsci, human will and consciousness, not mechanical economic stages, are the true engines of history.
Normally, class struggle proceeds gradually: workers pressure capitalists, production improves, class consciousness develops. But the war disrupted normal development and created exceptional conditions: "In Russia the war galvanized the people's will… their will became as one almost overnight."
 Socialist consciousness was formed through propaganda and necessity, The Russian people learned in thought what Western workers had learned through long experience, They refused to wait for the history of England to be repeated in Russia.
Just as America began at a higher capitalist level than England, Russia can start socialism at the most advanced theoretical level already achieved elsewhere. The revolution will create the conditions of socialism more quickly than capitalism would have: The revolutionaries themselves will create the conditions needed for the complete and full achievement of their goal… faster than capitalism could have done
The people’s hardships after the revolution will be bearable only if the proletarians feel they have things under their own control/
The maximalists at this moment are the spontaneous expression of a biological necessity, an organic force necessary to prevent collapse and starvation. The revolution, in this sense, expresses the collective survival instinct of a people, not just a political calculation.
## Our Marx
"Marx did not write a nice little doctrine, he is not a Messiah who left a string of parables laden with categorical imperatives. The only categorical imperative, the only norm: ‘Workers of the world, unite!"
The sole universal rule of Marxism is organization and solidarity of workers: the active, practical unification of the oppressed. 
Marx synthesized scattered intuitions into a coherent understanding of history grounded in material conditions and collective agency. 
Marx made human beings conscious participants in history, not passive subjects of fate or divine will. He transformed both thought and reality, his work itself transformed the world.
Marx stands in contrast to both mystical hero worship and mechanistic positivism, a historian grounded in the material process of life.
Before Marx, history was written as a story of ideas or great men. Marx revealed that the real substance of history is practical activity: production, exchange, and material relations. Ideas have meaning only when rooted in material social relations.
Real freedom comes through discipline to necessity: understanding and mastering the material constraints of existence. "The search for the substance of history… leads one to discover how human society is split into two classes."
"The class which owns the instruments of production already necessarily knows itself... The other class… acquires awareness of itself, of the task which it must now carry out in order to assert itself as a class."
	The ruling class already has organization and awareness; the proletariat must develop its own through struggle.
**Will is organized awareness, not arbitrary desire.**
	"Will, in a Marxist sense, means awareness of ends… knowledge of one’s own power and the means to express it in action"
Marx exemplifies disciplined, critical thought -- a model of intellectual honesty and moral strength, not blind leadership or dogma. Not an idol but a moment in humanity's long quest for self-understanding and a milestone in the development of collective human awareness.
Celebrating Marx is celebrating the self-consciousness and organizational power of the working class — its readiness to "crown all its efforts and sacrifices" in revolution.
## Class Intransigence and Italian History
"The state is the economic-political organization of the bourgeois class. The state is the bourgeois class in its modern, concrete expression"
	The classical Marxist view: the state isn’t neutral or above society. It’s the form through which the bourgeois class organizes and maintains its rule. It embodies the interests of the capitalist class as a whole, even if internal division exist between them at times.
"The bourgeois class is not a unified entity outside the state. As a result of the working of free competition, new groups of capitalist producers are constantly forming"
	Capitalists compete among themselves. The bourgeoisie is fragmented and clash economically. Each group wants to escape competition by forming monopolies and securing state favor.
"The state's function is to find a juridical settlement to internal class disputes, to clashes between opposed interests; thereby it unifies different groupings and gives the class a solid and united external appearance."
    The state acts as an arbiter within the capitalist class: reconciling internal economic conflicts through law, policy, and regulation. That way, it presents the bourgeoisie as a unified ruling class externally, even though it’s internally divided.
"Competition between groupings is concentrated at the point of government, , of state power. The government is the prize for the strongest bourgeois party or grouping…"
	When bourgeois factions compete politically, what’s really happening is the internal struggle of capitalists over who controls the machinery of the state. Each ruling group uses state power to advance its own economic program.
"The bourgeois parties are either the representatives of categories of producers, or they are simply a swarm of ‘coachman-flies’…"
	Bourgeois parties = either (a) interest groups representing sectors of capital, or (b) parasites -- opportunistic politicians feeding off corruption and patronage
"The Socialist Party is not a sectional, but a class organization… It can only view the state… as its antagonistic likeness."
	By contrast, the Socialist Party represents the entire proletariat, not a faction of producers. It therefore stands in direct antagonism to the bourgeois state in structural opposites.
"The Socialist Party does not conquer the state, it replaces it; it replaces the regime, abolishes party government and replaces free competition by the organization of production and exchange... It cannot enter into direct or indirect competition for the conquest of the state without committing suicide."
	The Socialist Party cannot ‘conquer’ the bourgeois state. If the Socialist Party simply competes for office within the existing bourgeois framework, it stops being revolutionary. It becomes a faction within the bourgeois system, not an agent of transformation, this would only mean adapting to its capitalist logic and defeat the point of it's existence. Socialism means building a new kind of state entirely, one that abolishes the capitalist regime of competition and private property, and replaces it with collective organization of production and exchange.
## Utopia
"Political constitutions are necessarily dependent on economic structure… but the relations are anything but simple and direct."
	The economy conditions politics, but does not determine it mechanically. Between them lies a complex world of human actions, beliefs, and interpretations.
"Quantity (economic structure) turns into quality because it becomes an instrument for action in men’s hands."
	People are not passive reflections of economics, but have minds, suffering, understanding and desires, and use these to transform material conditions through conscious activity, so economic forces only become decisive when mediated by human will and organization.
"In a proletarian revolution, the unknown variable ‘humanity’ is more mysterious than in any other event."
	You can’t predict revolutions purely from economic factors. What matters is the collective psychology and conscious will of the working class. We have no prior data on what the Russian proletariat is capable of and we’ll learn it through history itself.
"The assertion that Lenin is a utopian is not a cultural fact… it is a political act."
	Claiming the Russian revolution is not an act of neutral scholarship, they're taking a political position, defending reformism and discouraging revolution. Theory is being used to justify passivity.	
"Anyone who posits these pseudo-laws as absolutes… is incapable of seeing that psychology can change, weakness can become strength."
	The idea that history follows fixed stages is merely a historical tendency that depends on how people act and organize. When people stop being atomized and begin to organize and associate, they can break this law and leap ahead of supposed historical inevitability.
"The war represents the maximum concentration of economic activity… and a maximum concentration of individuals in the barracks and trenches"
	The Tsarist regime instituted despotic policies and created the conditions for proletarian unity in Russia. Isolated peasants were suddenly thrust together, they developed new feelings and an unprecedented human solidarity, and that solidarity became the basis for revolution. The revolution was generated by real social forces.
"The philistine sees no salvation outside pre-established schemas… But history is not an oak tree, and men are not acorns"
	Reformists claim that Russia must pass through a bourgeois stage before socialism. Gramsci mocks this as 'philistine' fatalism: the belief that history must unfold according to pre-made blueprints. He says this isn’t scientific materialism but a kind of religious determinism — like believing in divine right. True materialism recognizes freedom and human initiative as forces within history.
"In Russia the free expression of individual and combined energies has swept aside the obstacles of pre-established words and plans... The proletariat is establishing its own order… constructing political institutions which will ensure the autonomy of this development."
	The revolution is a spontaneous process of self-organization by the people, creating workers councils only of the workers, and that will execute their will.
"Dictatorship is the fundamental institution guaranteeing freedom… it is a transitional stage allowing the creation and consolidation of permanent organisms"
	The Bolshevik dictatorship is a temporary safeguard, not a tyranny, but a structure that protects the revolution against counterrevolution while building new democratic institutions (Soviets, parties, local councils). So dictatorship is paradoxically the condition for genuine freedom because it allows the working class to develop its own organs of power. (Obviously, this didn't age well, lol.)
"A hierarchy is being constituted… from the masses, to the Soviets, to the Bolshevik Party, and finally to one man: Lenin"
	There is a living, fluid hierarchy of participation, trust and confidence between the workers and the party based on open participation: Freedom through organization.
"Socialism is not established on a particular day—it is a continuous process, a never-ending development towards a realm of freedom."
	Socialism is a living historical movement: the ongoing self-organization and self-education of the proletariat. The revolution, then, is not the end but the beginning of that process.
