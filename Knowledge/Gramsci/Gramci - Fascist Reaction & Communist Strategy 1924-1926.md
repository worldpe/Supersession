#Philosophy/Gramsci [[Gramsci]]
## Introduction
In the wake of the Matteotti murder (June 1924), Gramsci interpreted the situation as Fascism’s first serious internal crisis. He believed there was a breakdown in the alliance between capitalists and the petty bourgeoisie, who had originally formed the mass base of Fascism but were now being economically squeezed by it. Gramsci thought this could drive the middle classes toward an alliance with the proletariat.
When the Aventine opposition formed, the PCI at first participated but withdrew after its demand for a general strike was rejected. Gramsci opposed continued collaboration with the Aventine because he viewed its politics as weak, legalistic, and confined within bourgeois democracy. He believed Italy was entering a democratic phase that would later create conditions favorable to socialist revolution, though in retrospect his stance was too sectarian, as Fascism soon consolidated a dictatorship (by 1926).Nevertheless, Gramsci was correct in identifying the immediate task for the left as democratic rather than revolutionary, and he recognized the importance of broadening the anti-fascist movement’s mass base through the united front tactic.
Gramsci’s time in Moscow (1922–1923) gave him deep familiarity with Soviet debates.
By 1924, he followed the intra-party struggle between Trotsky and Stalin (with Bukharin):
- Trotsky criticized bureaucratization and the **NEP**, advocating for **permanent revolution** and a continuous transition to socialism supported by global revolutions.
- Gramsci initially sympathized with Trotsky’s critique, writing that Trotsky’s group sought to preserve the proletarian character of the revolution and prevent a slide back toward a bourgeois “democratic dictatorship.”
- He also expressed alarm at Stalin’s attacks on Trotsky, which he called irresponsible and dangerous.
By 1926, however, Gramsci’s views shifted: he supported the majority’s pro-NEP position (Stalin and Bukharin) over Trotsky’s, while continuing to criticize the bureaucratic handling of internal disputes in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
Soviet discussions on the agrarian question, the creation of the Krestintern (Peasant International), and the Comintern’s campaign for Bolshevization influenced Gramsci’s reorientation of PCI policy. He began to promote slogans like workers and peasants government” and a federal workers and peasants republic. He drew especially on Bukharin’s idea of a bloc of workers and peasants, where the industrial proletariat exercises hegemony (leadership) within an alliance that includes the peasantry. This contrasted with Trotsky’s view of proletarian dictatorship over the peasantry, which Bukharin and Gramsci saw as too narrowly based on Western, industrial conditions.
Gramsci’s most important theoretical contributions from this period appear in:
- The Lyons Theses (1926), co-written with Togliatti, which analyzed Fascism, class structure, and party strategy in Italy as a model of concrete Marxist analysis; and
- The unfinished essay Some Aspects of the Southern Question, written just before his arrest. In the latter, Gramsci connected Soviet debates on the worker-peasant alliance to Italian conditions, laying the groundwork for his later theories of hegemony and the role of intellectuals developed in the Prison Notebooks.
## The Crisis of the Middle Classes
Fascism in Italy arose from the crisis of the middle classes after World War I. Unlike in more industrialized countries, Italy’s petty bourgeoisie was both numerous and the only truly national class, due to the limited and regional nature of Italian industry. When the capitalist crisis weakened both the economy and the unity of the Italian state, the middle classes turned to Fascism, which appeared to defend national unity and order. The working class’s failure in 1920 to create a revolutionary alternative left the path open for Fascism to take power.
By the mid-1920s, Gramsci saw Fascism entering a crisis, as it accelerated rather than halted the decline of the middle classes. Economic policies favored big capitalists and ruined small and medium producers, causing a transfer of wealth upward. Fascism could not solve Italy’s economic problems; instead, it intensified inequality and left the petty bourgeoisie impoverished.
Gramsci rejects the idea that Fascism has a fixed essence. It is a product of a specific balance of class forces, a historical phenomenon, not an ideology with coherent principles. Its originality lies in having organized the petty bourgeoisie into a mass movement with military discipline: the Fascist militia being its true core. Fascism has no intellectual or political cohesion beyond this militarized unity. It cannot truly conquer the state because the petty bourgeoisie plays no essential role in production; only the working class, through control of the factory, can do that.
The Italian crisis can only be resolved by the proletariat, through participation in a European and world revolution. Fascism has delayed the possibility of proletarian revolution. After Fascism’s collapse, the revolution will become more broadly popular, rooted in the masses experience of suffering under Fascism.
Gramsci characterizes the moment as a democratic phase, a transitional period in which the working class is fragmented and disorganized. The Communist Party’s immediate task is not to seize power but to build strength, win over the majority of workers, and prepare for future revolutionary struggles. The party must combat both rightist tendencies seeking compromise with liberal or reformist opposition groups, and ultra-leftist factions that want to force premature uprisings.
The party must build Communist cells in every factory and village to become a mass party capable of political leadership. It must also rebuild and lead trade unions, which are essential for moving beyond parliamentary democracy. The Communists must take part in everyday struggles to connect with the masses. These local and factory-based struggles should lead to city-wide workers’ committees, potential embryos of future revolutionary power.
The goal is to transform the democratic state from within, molecularly, by organizing and politicizing the working masses. Through sustained agitation, organization, and education, the Communist Party will become the political expression of the entire working population, capable of leading Italy toward socialist revolution.
## The Italian Situation and the Tasks of the PCI (Lyons Theses)
The Lyon Theses represent:
- A rejection of both right-wing reformism and Bordigist left-sectarianism.
- A call for a centralized, proletarian, Marxist-Leninist party, modeled on the Bolsheviks.
- A focus on political preparation, mass connection, and insurrectionary strategy.
 - A new Comintern-aligned, Gramscian direction for the PCI.
Italy is a capitalist country with pre-capitalist residues, where capitalism’s weakness, regional unevenness, and fragmented ruling classes make it vulnerable to crisis. The working class, through alliance with the Southern peasantry, holds the only coherent, national, and revolutionary project capable of overcoming Italy’s historical divisions and creating a truly unified socialist state. Fascism is not an anomaly but the logical outcome of capitalist crisis in a weak Italian state. It preserves capitalist power by violently suppressing class struggle, yet in doing so, it deepens the contradictions that will fuel a future revolution. The Italian proletariat, in alliance with the Southern peasantry, remains the only revolutionary force capable of overcoming both Fascism and bourgeois democracy.
capitalism dominates Italian society and determines its development. the only real revolution possible in Italy is a socialist revolution led by the working class, since only it can achieve a deep social transformation. The form of this revolution depends on the uneven development of capitalism and the specific Italian social structure.
Industrial capitalism in Italy is weak due to limited natural resources and geographic constraints. Italy’s economy remains largely agrarian, divided among poor and diverse rural strata, with many peasants living in near-proletarian conditions. Between workers and peasants stands a large urban petty bourgeoisie, which plays a key role in Italy’s social dynamics.
The Italian bourgeoisie maintains control through alliances between industrialists and large landowners rather than through open competition. This industrial–agrarian bloc is an arrangement among privileged groups that exploits the majority and blocks national development. he result is regional inequality, economic stagnation, mass poverty, and emigration, especially from the South.
Because the capitalist class cannot dominate on its own, the Italian state is built on compromises among disparate groups. This produces a weak, heterogeneous state, dependent on foreign powers during its formation, lacking an internal class capable of genuine national leadership.
The relations between industry and agriculture in Italy have a territorial basis: industrial capitalism dominates the North, while the South is economically dependent and underdeveloped. The South is treated like a colonial territory: Northern industry exploits it as a metropolis exploits a colony. Southern landlords and bourgeoisie act as colonial collaborators, oppressing the peasantry on behalf of the North.
Italy's proletariat has exceptional political importance, comparable to pre-revolutionary Russia’s. Italian industry’s reliance on skilled labor and the fragmentation of the ruling classes make the proletariat the only cohesive and unifying social force. The working class’s program is the only one that could create genuine national unity, since it transcends regional and class divisions. The rural proletariat, especially in the Po Valley, can easily join the industrial working class in a common revolutionary struggle. Thus, revolutionary conditions may arise more readily in Italy’s structurally weak capitalism than in stronger, more stable capitalist states.
Since unification, the bourgeoisie’s central goal has been to prevent the working masses from organizing around the proletariat and forming a revolutionary movement. Because Italian capitalism is weak, the bourgeoisie maintains control through compromises among ruling groups rather than through economic strength or ideological hegemony. These compromises repeatedly block development, create crises, and provoke mass unrest, forcing greater repression and setting the stage for revolutionary mobilization.
The consolidation of industrial–agrarian power after unification laid the conditions for revolution: A Northern proletariat and Southern peasantry emerged as oppressed classes. The South’s “colonial” exploitation demanded increasing political repression. Spontaneous revolts, such as the Sicilian Fasci (1890s), revealed a potential unity between Northern workers and Southern peasants, even if the Socialist Party failed to recognize or develop it.
After World War I, industrial concentration intensified, and the proletariat reached its peak of organization. The bourgeoisie and Vatican responded by: Creating Catholic parties to integrate peasants into the bourgeois framework. Promoting reformist labor leaders to divide and corrupt the workers’ movement. However, these strategies could not produce a stable bourgeois government due to the disunity of the ruling classes and the absence of a strong capitalist core.
The revolutionary wave (1919–1920) failed not because of the strength of the bourgeoisie, but because of the weakness and errors of the workers’ movement. Fascism’s victory in 1922 was therefore not the defeat of revolution, but the consequence of the proletariat’s failure to carry it through.
Fascism is not a new class force, but a continuation of traditional Italian bourgeois and landowning domination. It arose as a reactionary movement to crush and fragment the working class, backed by all old ruling groups, especially landowners threatened by peasant unrest. Its social base lay in the urban petty bourgeoisie and a new rural middle class emerging from agrarian capitalism. What distinguishes Fascism is its attempt to unify all bourgeois forces into a single political organism, merging party, government, and state, to maintain capitalist order. Economically, Fascism serves industrial and agrarian oligarchies, concentrating wealth in a small plutocracy through protectionism, taxation, and finance capital, while impoverishing workers, peasants, and petty bourgeoisie.
Fascism’s economic measures, high tariffs, pro-plutocratic fiscal policy, 'battle for wheat', and banking centralization, further the North–South divide, worsening the subjugation of Southern Italy. This policy creates discontent among the petty bourgeoisie and peasantry, who realize Fascism benefits only big capital. Politically, Fascism attempts to maintain control through Repression, Corporatist control & Militarization of society. Bordiga stresses that Fascism's stability is only apparent, since repression masks deepening class contradictions.
Despite repression, class consciousness persists among the proletariat, and both peasants and petty bourgeois are becoming radicalized. In the South, the extreme exploitation under Fascism accelerates revolt potential and alliances between peasants and workers. The Matteotti crisis showed that beneath Fascist order, explosive contradictions remain. However, the petty bourgeoisie cannot independently lead a revolutionary struggle.
The main revolutionary forces are: The industrial and rural proletariat, primarily in the North. The Southern and island peasantry, whose liberation is tied to alliance with the proletariat. The revolution will become immediately possible once the working class reorganizes itself, gains class independence, and reasserts leadership over other exploited strata. The alliance between workers and peasants is natural and historical, born of Italy’s uneven capitalist development and the North–South divide.
Anti-fascist liberal and democratic groups are not allies of the proletariat. Their function is to contain class struggle and prevent workers from acting independently. Any left or democratic government emerging from anti-fascist opposition would be another bourgeois maneuver, a softer form of reaction meant to divert revolutionary energy. The bourgeoisie may alternate between open fascist repression and democratic compromises, depending on which better maintains capitalist rule.
The Communist Party must base its strategy on this analysis: Organize and maintain proletarian independence from all bourgeois and reformist influences. Prepare the workers–peasants alliance as the basis for a revolutionary insurrection. Recognize that fascism and bourgeois democracy are two tactics of the same class enemy.
The PCI’s role is to prepare the revolution through organization and leadership. The party has survived fascist repression and reorganized the proletarian vanguard after 1923–24. Italy is now in the phase of political preparation for revolution. The PCI’s three core tasks: Unify and organize industrial and rural proletarians for revolution. Mobilize allies around the proletariat. Prepare for insurrection and the establishment of the proletarian dictatorship through a sequence of partial struggles.
The PCI must transform itself into a true vanguard party. Italian workers learned from 1919–20 that without a revolutionary party, the proletariat cannot win. The party must be: Rooted in Marxist-Leninist ideology. Cohesive and disciplined in organization. In close contact with the masses. Strategically and tactically capable of leadership.
The party needs ideological unity based on Marxism-Leninism and must combat rightist deviations. The basis of unity is Marxism-Leninism, adapted to the age of imperialism. Rightist danger comes from revisionism (Graziadei) and reformist tendencies that promote passivity. These deviations lead to the illusion that socialism can come through constitutional means or bourgeois alliances. Social democracy is no longer the right wing of the workers movement but the left wing of the bourgeoisie.
The party must also reject ultra-leftism, represented by Bordiga. Views the party abstractly, as an organ above classes, rather than as a part of the proletariat. Believes the party’s role is just to educate cadres until conditions ripen, not to lead the masses continuously. Bases tactics on formal principles rather than objective conditions. This leads to sectarian isolation, ignoring mass struggles and losing dialectical flexibility.
The party must be organized on the basis of production, through factory cells. All organizational problems are political. The PCI must be a class party, rooted in workplaces, not a mixture of social layers. The factory cell system ensures unity between all layers of workers and the elimination of divisions and labour aristocracy. Intellectuals and peasants can and should join, but under proletarian leadership. Any idea that the party should be a synthesis of different classes is counter-revolutionary.
The party must be strictly centralized and disciplined, with no factions. Iron proletarian discipline under a Central Committee is required. Leadership must come through both election and tested experience avoiding purely formal or parliamentary internal politics. Unlike social-democratic parties that tolerate internal blocs and debates, the Communist Party must be unified under one central line. Internal diversity is expressed through participation, not organized factions. The PCI must be a monolithic, disciplined, proletarian vanguard, not a coalition of tendencies.
The Party must be able to function effectively even under Fascist repression. Fascism prevents the working class from organizing openly, masking the real relation of forces in society. the Party must be highly concentrated, disciplined, and active, capable of maintaining contact with the masses under all conditions. Constant activity is needed to neutralize repression and keep the revolutionary process alive.
Revolutionary leadership means uniting and guiding all the forces necessary for victory. The Party’s strategic capacity = ability to unify and organize the proletariat and allies toward revolution. It must seize opportunities created by shifts in the balance of class forces. The Party leads not by proclaiming itself the vanguard but by earning recognition from the masses through concrete activity. It must root itself in the class, link with all its layers, and move them in line with objective conditions. True leadership means building mass confidence and majority support.
Communists must lead from within the workers mass organizations, not apart from them. The Party leads by penetrating all organizations where workers are gathered. Communists must promote Party ideas while avoiding isolation or sectarian withdrawal. Avoid pessimism and passivity, abstaining from mass work is a deviation. Trade-union activity is essential for building revolutionary strength. The Party must defend the class union, demand its freedom, and foster representative mass organs. The PCI must guide all fragmented struggles toward class unity and revolutionary direction.
Participation in partial and immediate struggles is necessary to build mass unity and revolutionary consciousness. The Party must lead and unify the working class by taking part in all limited struggles, as such struggles are steps toward broader mobilization. The Party rejects abstentionism refusing to engage in partial actions because only revolution matters is a leftist error.
Immediate demands can be Economic or political. Under Fascism, even the fight for elementary freedoms can be a revolutionary catalyst. The Party must link every partial demand to its overall revolutionary programme, showing that only through struggle can change come. Civil war is the ultimate logical outcome of genuine anti-Fascist struggle.
The united front is both a practical necessity and a tactical method, to achieve unity of the working class in struggle, to resist Fascism and capitalism. Unity is not abstract but organizational, built through representative bodies that emerge from real struggles. Communists must overcome hostility toward non-Communist workers and work from below to unite all forces willing to fight. The united front must remain class-based, not an alliance of democratic elites. The tactic as manoeuvre used to unmask reformist and social-democratic leaders with mass followings. When open confrontation isn’t yet possible, Communists work with them temporarily to expose their contradictions through action. The united front is both a bridge to revolutionary leadership and a means to break the isolation of Communists.
The Party may propose intermediate slogans to expose reformist parties and win the masses. The PCI can advance intermediate demands between its final goals and the passive programmes of reformists. These slogans must mobilize broad forces, bridge the gap between daily struggles and the dictatorship of the proletariat, and reveal, through practice, the inconsistency of bourgeois-democratic and reformist parties. The Bolshevik precedent: supporting Kerensky against Kornilov not to defend liberalism, but to expose its limits and hasten revolution.
A unifying political slogan linking immediate demands to the seizure of power. The workers and peasants government slogan expresses: The need for power to solve urgent problems. The alliance of proletariat and peasantry. A transitional agitational formula, not an actual political stage distinct from the dictatorship of the proletariat. It is valuable as propaganda, but must never be mistaken for a stable, non-revolutionary form of government. Any interpretation that sees it as a democratic stage before socialism is revisionist and leads to deviation from revolutionary goals.
A Communist Party must operate under repression and through stages of struggle: It must maintain flexible, underground organization, Root itself in mass organizations, Engage in partial and democratic struggles as means to build revolutionary unity, Use the united front tactically to break reformist influence, Propose transitional demands that push the masses toward socialism, and Keep the dictatorship of the proletariat as the ultimate, non-negotiable goal.
## Letter to the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party
**[[Hegemony]]:** The moral, intellectual, and political leadership of one class over others, not through domination, but through the active consent of the governed.
The PCI expresses anxiety over the growing split inside the CPSU on the eve of its Fifteenth Conference. In past internal debates they trusted that unity would prevail; now that confidence is gone. The crisis seems organic and dangerous, threatening the very leadership core that has guided both the CPSU and the Communist International.
The conflict inside the CPSU has global repercussions because the Soviet Party is the vanguard and model for all Communist parties. A split or even prolonged tension would undermine the hegemony of the CPSU in the Communist International. The bourgeois press and states are exploiting the split to show it as proof that the Soviet regime is collapsing or reverting to capitalism. Even Italian Fascists are using it in propaganda to demoralize workers and make Fascism appear as a historical necessity.
The CPSU must recognize its international responsibility: its internal battles affect every Communist party. The PCI feels the crisis most sharply, since it depends heavily on Soviet leadership for guidance. The CPSU must preserve unity and discipline, not through coercion, but through conviction and political clarity.
The real issue is the question of proletarian hegemony, the relationship between workers and peasants in the Soviet state. The United Opposition misunderstands this, their approach revives the old errors of Social Democracy and syndicalism. the proletariat’s historic role requires sacrifice and leadership over the peasantry and other classes. The proletariat must transcend its narrow interests to maintain its hegemony in the workers state, even under the contradictions of the NEP.
The ruler, the proletariat, lives worse than certain Nepmen and petty bourgeois strata, and It’s easy to exploit this with demagogic slogans. Reformists use similar rhetoric after strikes, appealing to workers immediate suffering. But for Gramsci, Leninism teaches that revolutionary leadership means enduring such contradictions in the service of long-term socialist construction.
The left opposition risks undoing everything they helped build, but he also cautions the majority not to pursue excessive measures that could permanently alienate the opposition. "The damage caused by the error of a united party is easily mended; that caused by a split may be irreparable.
