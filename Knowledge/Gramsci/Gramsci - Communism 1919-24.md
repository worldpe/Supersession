#Philosophy/Gramsci [[Gramsci]]
## Introduction
The PCI was formed in January 1921 at the Livorno Congress, out of a split from the Socialist Party (PSI). It united three currents: left maximalists, Bordiga’s Naples-based communist fraction, and the Turin Ordine Nuovo group. Bordiga became the first general secretary (1921–23), leading the party along a rigid, vanguardist course. This approach proved politically disastrous as Fascism came to power in 1922, because the party remained inflexible and refused cooperation with other left-wing forces.
In December 1921, the Comintern launched the ‘united front’ policy, urging Communists to ally with left Socialists. In Italy, this would have meant fusion with left-wing Socialists seeking Comintern affiliation. Bordiga opposed it, seeing the Communist Party as the sole revolutionary leader and the Fascist regime as a temporary capitalist crisis that would eventually collapse or be overthrown. The party’s Second Congress in March 1922 approved Bordiga’s anti-united-front stance.
From autumn 1923, a new leadership group emerged around Gramsci and Togliatti. This group gradually: Assessed Fascism more accurately, understanding its structural power. Viewed the party as a potential mass organization, not just a rigid vanguard. Became more open to tactical alliances with other organizations while maintaining Communist leadership.
Four distinctive features of Gramsci’s political thought in this period:
- Centrality of the peasant question: Peasants in southern Italy were key to revolutionary change. Alliance of industrial workers and peasants under Communist leadership was necessary to modernize agriculture and overthrow southern subordination.
- Attentiveness to changing class forces: Gramsci emphasized realistic assessments of shifts in political power. The PSI had failed to engage the politicized peasantry, who instead turned to the catholic party, and the petty bourgeoisie, who turned to the Fascists.
- Relations with the Comintern: Like Bordiga, he opposed a rigid united front from above and criticized Comintern centralism, but unlike Bordiga, he prioritized disciplined internationalism while adapting strategy to Italy’s specific conditions.
- Conception of the party: Gramsci rejected Bordiga’s strictly vanguardist model. He envisioned a dialectical relationship between membership and leadership, combining mass democratic impulses with clear leadership. This concept would be elaborated further in the Lyons Congress (1926) and his Prison Notebooks, contrasting democratic vs. organic (bureacratic) centralism.
## The War in the Colonies
Algerian socialists put out a 1902 resolution that accuses the French colonial rulers of hypocrisy: They claim to bring civilization and education to the colonized, but in practice they only replace old exploiters (the Turks) with new ones (the French). The colonizers promise of enlightenment is revealed as empty and their real aim is extraction and domination, not moral or cultural development. 
World War I dramatically deepened colonial exploitation, colonies were stripped of food, raw materials, and labor to feed the war machines of Europe. This was done with brutal, inhuman methods, exposing capitalism’s true nature. Millions of Indians, Egyptians, Algerians, Tunisians, and Vietnamese died of hunger and disease. Colonial economies were devastated by European competition and forced extraction. Europeans lived off the death of coloured peoples.
Out of this suffering, a global revolt is emerging, a rebellion not just economic but spiritual and cultural, a drive for autonomy, independence, and human dignity. Colonized peoples are beginning to reunite and rediscover solidarity after being divided by European domination.
Turkish resistance after WWI, such as the rise of Ataturk's nationalist movement, stand out as inspiration for other colonized peoples. Even though Turkey was defeated, its independence struggle symbolized dignity and defiance. The Anatolian shepherd now commands more respect among colonized peoples than the European capitalist: The moral prestige of anti-imperial struggle is now higher than that of European civilization.
"Armoured cars, tanks and machine-guns perform wonders... But the extortions of capitalism are far more deadly..."
The formerly passive colonial peoples are awakening to political consciousness, even against modern military technology, and this uprising represents the extension of the class struggle to the global scale.
## Workers and Peasants
Countries like Russia, Italy, France, and Spain have a clear divide between urban workers and rural peasants. Feudal economic structures and mentalities persist in agriculture, leaving peasants with limited understanding of the modern state or collective organization. Peasant revolts were often individualistic and episodic, resembling brigandage rather than systematic class struggle.
The war forced peasants into collective experiences, concentrating scattered individuals and exposing them to discipline, sacrifice, and shared danger. This created a new social consciousness, blunted selfish instincts, and fostered solidarity, discipline, and awareness of broader social and political realities. Russian soldiers and returning peasants formed Soviets (councils), gaining practical experience in self-governance and class unity.
War experiences accelerated the development of collective consciousness that industrialism alone had not produced. Peasants and workers now had the mental and social readiness to participate in organized revolutionary action. This new psychology must be channeled through proper institutions to consolidate gains and avoid disorder.
Italy faces similar challenges: backward agriculture, separation of workers and peasants, and an underdeveloped capitalist state. Post-war agricultural transformation requires machinery, centralized production, and coordination, only feasible under a socialist state.
Industrial workers and poor peasants are the irreducible elements of the revolution: they provide energy, discipline, and implacable determination. Communism represents civilization, dignity, and freedom for them. Revolutionary success depends on meeting their needs and structuring the movement according to their capacities and mentality.
Left unorganized, peasants could degenerate into disorderly, violent elements. Revolution requires linking urban workers with rural peasants, establishing institutions in the countryside for the socialist state, and directing industrial and agricultural transformation. Returning wartime migrants to factories can act as a bridge between town and countryside, facilitating propaganda and organizing peasants into revolutionary institutions.
## The Livorno Congress
The Livorno Congress is about far more than party politics: it is about the future of Italy’s working class and its ability to achieve both national liberation and participation in the international revolutionary movement.
It is a decisive moment for the Italian working class to determine whether it can form an autonomous, class-based party. 
The working class is both national and international: it must lead the emancipation of the working people in Italy and contribute to the world revolution. Italy’s national task is shaped by the structure of Italian capitalism, which dominates the South and the countryside via the industrial North. Only the working class can resolve the 'Southern Question' and unify Italy economically and socially, building on the territorial unification achieved by the Risorgimento.
The Congress will formalize the split between communists and reformists. Reformist are parasitic and dependent on the capitalist state, while seeking proletarian aristocracy rather than genuine emancipation. True emancipation requires alliance between industrial workers of the North and poor peasants of the South, aiming to smash the bourgeois state.
The goal of the revolutionary program is to overthrow the bourgeois state, establish a workers and peasants state and reorganize industrial and agricultural production to serve workers and peasants and modernize backward agriculture.
The Italian revolution cannot succeed in isolation; it must be part of the global revolutionary movement. The Communist International’s Executive Committee is seen as a model of centralized coordination for world working-class action. Discipline and coordination in Italy are necessary to mirror the global struggle and ensure mutual support from other revolutionary forces.
## Parties and Masses
The masses exist politically only through organization in parties. Parties interpret changes in mass sentiment caused by economic forces and evolve by splitting, fusing, and reorganizing. This process reveals the breakdown of democratic society and leads to a clear alignment of classes around power struggles.
The Socialist Party initially represented the Italian working people: industrial proletariat, petty bourgeoisie, and poor peasants. Only the industrial proletariat is essentially and permanently revolutionary. Petty bourgeois and peasant elements are occasionally revolutionary, reacting to short-term anti-government or war-induced sentiments. The Socialist Party’s majority composition of non-proletarian elements made it hesitant, programmatically weak, and without internationalist consciousness.
The occupation of factories (1920) was primarily a proletarian initiative. The Socialist Party, partially proletarian and dominated by reformist/peasant elements, was unprepared for its challenges. After the occupation ended, the party fell into confusion, demoralized by apparent bourgeois strength (Giolitti, Fascists) and reformist leadership.
After the Socialist Party’s decline, petty bourgeois defectors gravitated toward Fascism. Peasants moved toward the Popular Party. Former Socialist unity between workers and peasants disintegrated, but this also allowed the Popular Party to move left and secularize. This "disarticulation" of the Socialist Party represents a transition toward a new class-based alignment.
The urban petty bourgeoisie had gained organizational experience in the war. Initially fragmented after the armistice, they were reorganized by military leadership and allied with landowners. Fascism briefly exploited their anti-government rebellion, but the petty bourgeoisie sought political independence, aligning in some ways with moderate socialist policies.
Italy’s popular masses are now re-aligning along class lines:
- Industrial proletariat -> Communist Party
- Peasantry -> Popular Party
- Urban petty bourgeoisie -> Fascists
## What the Relations Should be Between the PCl and the Comintern
The Italian CP had formally pledged discipline to the Comintern but acted in ways that suggested evasion of its directives. This created a perception of disloyalty or unreliability toward the international organization
Unanimity in public votes is crucial, Internal debate should occur privately, maintaining unity publicly. 
The Comintern’s tactics, especially the united front, were poorly understood and implemented outside Russia. 
The CP in Italy must maintain its ideological center and historical role. It cannot compromise with Socialists or allow the Comintern to shift the party’s core toward reformist elements. The Italian CP’s independence is framed as essential to defend the Italian revolution.
The Comintern’s representatives sometimes spread disintegration and corruption among Italian communists. The party must fight against elements that would liquidate or compromise it, especially under conditions of illegality and exile. Mistakes may be made, but the priority is to preserve the integrity and revolutionary mission of the CP.
## Letter to Togliatti, Terracini and Others
There should be a nationally grounded, rigorously organized Communist Party with active mass engagement, clear internal structures, and strategic planning tailored to Italy’s social, economic, and political reality. He critiques over-reliance on Comintern tactics designed for Russia and emphasizes the need for concrete, practical preparation across key sectors and regions.
The party mistakenly treated itself as a unitary revolutionary whole, ignoring the role of individual members. This led to passivity among members, over-reliance on leaders, and opportunism. Local activists and rank-and-file members were insufficiently engaged; leadership relied on functionaries who often lacked credibility locally. Agitation and propaganda were neglected; factory cells and continuous mass engagement were underdeveloped.
The party had disagreements with the Comintern and minority factions (especially Bordiga). Bordiga’s approach, modeled on Russia, emphasized voluntaristic, centralized revolutionary tactics appropriate for a backward capitalist country, but unsuited for Italy, a more developed capitalist country with trade unions, labor aristocracy, and social-democratic elements. Masci argues the party should focus on national majority interests rather than international minority positions, resisting being subordinated to minority ideas simply because they align with the Comintern.
Strengthen the Central Committee (CC) and clarify division of labor and responsibilities between party bodies. Create new bodies: 
- Control Commission to resolve internal disputes and monitor membership.
- Agitation and Propaganda Committee to coordinate materials, study local conditions, and plan activities systematically.
Develop detailed theses on Italy’s political situation and anticipate multiple phases of revolutionary struggle. Recognize the role of emerging opposition from industrial bourgeoisie, the social-democratic majority among workers, and regional differences. Strategy must mobilize key sectors, including Milanese industrial workers, seamen, railway workers, and southern peasants, rather than leaving it to local initiative. Recruitment of highly committed cadres from across Italy to critical areas (like Milan) is essential.
Italy is more developed than Russia; historical determinism and social structures mean revolutionary action must be more complex, long-term, and cautious.
